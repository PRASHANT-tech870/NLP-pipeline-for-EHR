1. The inception.py file is basically the INCEPTION/GOOGLENET architecture model being run on Kaggle Tumor Dataset classifying the MRI IMAGES into 4 classes namely-GLIOMA, PITUITARY , MENINGIOMA and NO TUMOR.<br>
2.The same INCEPTION-V1 architecture was also trained on the OASIS ALZHEIMERS DATASET. <br>
3.The model performed well with approx. 89% and 98% accuracy metrics respectively.<br>
4.Transfer Learning method was used, VGG16 Conv Base was retrained with Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients(derived from Aster Hospital data).<br>
5.The accuracy achieved was 99%.<br>
6.Using the Inception v1 Module as Conv Base and retraining on Stroke patient's data produced similar results.Verification for Overfitting still underway.
