 The inception.py file is basically the INCEPTION/GOOGLENET architecture model being run on Kaggle Tumor Dataset classifying the MRI IMAGES into 4 classes namely-GLIOMA, PITUITARY , MENINGIOMA and NO TUMOR.
The same INCEPTION-V1 architecture was also trained on the OASIS ALZHEIMERS DATASET. 
The model performed well with approx. 89% and 98% accuracy metrics.
