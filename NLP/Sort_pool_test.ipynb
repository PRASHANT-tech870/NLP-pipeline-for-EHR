      "['A 95-year-old lady with a past medical history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), hypertension, and asthma presented to the emergency department for evaluation of nausea, vomiting, and a two-month history of intermittent diarrhea, which had been worsening for a few days prior to admission.Diarrhea was associated with severe, diffuse, waxing, and waning abdominal cramps, which were noted to improve after emesis.No correlation was noted with eating habits and no history of recent antibiotic use was reported.On examination, the abdomen was soft but tender on deep palpation, with audible bowel sounds.No organomegaly or costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness was appreciated.\\\\nInitial laboratory results revealed hypokalemia (3.3 mEq/L), lipase within normal limits (32 U/L), and normal transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]: 19 U/L; alanine aminotransferase [ALT]: 10 U/L) and bilirubin (total bilirubin: 0.7 mg/dl; direct bilirubin: 0.1 mb/dl).Stool studies were unremarkable and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was negative.CT abdomen revealed a long segment of the colon with a loop within loop appearance from the proximal transverse colon to the distal descending colon, consistent with intussusception (Figures , ).The underlying lesion for the lead point was not well identified.\\\\nThe patient was taken to the operating room the next day where local exploration using laparoscopy revealed complete telescoping and intussusception of terminal ileum into the distended ascending and transverse colon.At that time, it was decided to proceed with an open procedure and right hemicolectomy extending from the terminal ileum to about one-third of proximal transverse attachment of the mid transverse colon was performed and side-side anastomosis was created between terminal ileum and transverse colon at the anti-mesenteric border.The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.Surgical pathology revealed a tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia as the lead point of the intussusceptum.It was negative for in-situ or invasive carcinoma.The postoperative course was significant for acute kidney injury (Cr 1.3 mg/dl with oliguria) on postoperative day two, which resolved after administration of IV fluids.The patient was discharged home with home care services on postoperative day six.', \"A 47-year-old Caucasian male with a history of an aortic valve replacement, Factor V Leiden anomaly, migraines, and a competitive cycling hobby presented with new paracentral blind spots in the right eye following a fishing trip in Florida on August 28, 2014.The patient reported that the vision loss began during a fishing trip when he became dehydrated and had not resolved.He described three to four similar events that occurred previously following episodes of extreme physical activity, however, all resolving.On presentation in 2016, visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes.No fundus abnormalities were noted.Amsler grid testing revealed two scotomas about 1 and 4 degrees superior nasal to fixation in the right eye.Spectral-domain OCT imaging also revealed several hyperreflective bands in the middle retina of the right eye (Figure ).In Figure , the hyporeflective lesions seen at the border of the fovea inferior temporal and slightly further out were consistent with his subjective superior nasal scotomas on Amsler grid testing.Spectral-domain OCT findings of PAMM were corroborated with the Chief of the Retinal Service at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.The patient was diagnosed with findings consistent with PAMM.At that time, no treatment was given.While diagnostic measures were not taken during this patient’s first few described episodes, it was thought that the previous episodes were also consistent with PAMM, given their similar presentation on the Amsler grid testing and symptomatology.\\\\nIn mid-2018, the patient presented with a left-sided visual scotoma that had developed following a recent episode of febrile gastroenteritis.Treatment started with niacinamide OTC minerals, which helped initially over 30-40 minutes.After consulting with his cardiologist, nitroglycerin was prescribed but not taken.The patient was treated with 325 mg of aspirin and 200 mg of ibuprofen every 4 hours, with minimal relief.Aspirin and ibuprofen were administered because they are anti-inflammatory and blood thinners.The scotoma improved over the course of the next week but did not fully resolve.A permanent small scotoma remained.\\\\nIn 2019, the patient began to experience similar symptoms after vigorous exercise.The patient was treated with 0.4 mg nitroglycerin sublingually previously prescribed by his cardiologist.Within 45 minutes, the visual scotoma improved, and within a few hours, it completely resolved.Since this occasion, the patient experienced two subsequent episodes of the development of visual scotomas, both resolving within minutes of the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin.\\\\nThe patient described the lesions as permanent obstructions in the field of vision.They appear as small opaque structures, with a purple hue.The structures blend into the background without a distinct outline.The right eye lesions seen in Figure appeared at about 11 o’clock in the field of the patient's vision and did not move.\", 'A 15-year-old girl presented with chronic complaints of nasal obstruction and hyposmia on the left side.The patient had nasal obstruction symptoms for 6 months; before which she was asymptomatic.She was taking self-administered medications without relief.She had no history of maxillo-facial surgery or trauma in the past.She had no relevant family history or congenital anomalies.Upon clinical examination of the nose, there was a bump along the floor of the left nasal cavity, and her intraoral dentition appeared normal.\\\\nA plain radiograph of the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity was performed which showed a radiopaque focus in the left nasal cavity (Figure ).\\\\nThe CT scan of paranasal sinuses showed a tooth-like bony structure with a pulp cavity in the hard palate extending into the left inferior nasal cavity and a deviated nasal septum with convexity to the left (Figures -); a shape resembling a canine with a relatively smaller size.\\\\nOrthopantomogram showed a tooth-like radiopaque structure (white arrow) (Figure ).A three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) scan showed a tooth-like structure in the left nasal cavity (Figure ).\\\\nThis intranasal tooth was supernumerary.Mild mucosal thickening was noted in the bilateral maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.No tooth-like structures were found on the right side.All other teeth appeared normal.The patient had complete resolution of nasal obstruction and hyposmia following endoscopic removal of the ectopic intranasal tooth.', 'A 34-year-old female was transferred from a peripheral hospital 10 days after an elective lower uterine section caesarean section for a breech presentation for which she had an epidural anaesthetic.She presented to her general practitioner with a 2-day history of increasing right leg weakness.She was referred to her local hospital where she presented as no longer able to walk.Her examination demonstrated 0/5 power in right ankle flexion, extension, eversion and inversion with increased tone.Her cranial nerve examination was normal as was her tone and reflexes.An urgent MRI of the spine was undertaken that revealed no evidence of epidural collection or neural compression.', 'An 88-year-old woman (height, 150 cm; weight, 41 kg) with no history of drug allergy or general anesthesia was scheduled for transfemoral TAVI because of severe aortic stenosis (AS).The surgery was performed under general anesthesia to facilitate the use of transesophageal echocardiography and to manage any intraoperative complications.She was taking 0.625 mg/day bisoprolol, a selective β-1 blocker, for hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation.Additionally, she was taking amlodipine for hypertension.Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed severe AS (aortic valve peak flow velocity: 4.73 m/s; mean aortic valve pressure gradient: 47 mmHg; aortic valve area: 0.41 cm2) and myocardial hypertrophy (left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular septum thickness: 14 mm).\\\\nPre-anesthetic medication for sedation was not administered.She received bisoprolol and amlodipine 3 h before entering the operating room.Figure shows the anesthesia record.General anesthesia was induced using midazolam and remifentanil; additionally, rocuronium was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation.She received total intravenous anesthesia: continuous infusions of propofol and remifentanil.Noradrenaline and dopamine were infused continuously through the central venous catheter to maintain blood pressure.AS disappeared after valve implantation.During the surgery, complete atrioventricular block occurred, and ventricular pacing (VVI mode: 60 ppm) was initiated.No other complications were associated with the surgical procedure.Postoperatively, she received 100 mg sugammadex through the central venous catheter, but 2 min later, her systolic arterial blood pressure (ABP) decreased unexpectedly to less than 40 mmHg. Simultaneously, ventilator monitoring revealed elevated peak and plateau airway pressures (60 and 40 cmH2O, respectively).No skin rash was observed on the body surface.Transthoracic echocardiography showed underfilling of the left ventricle without right ventricular dilatation or pericardial effusion.No abnormalities were observed in left ventricular wall motion.\\\\nThe patient developed distributive shock, which was clinically diagnosed as anaphylactic shock caused by sugammadex because of the rapid onset of severe hypotension and bronchospasm.First, two boluses of 0.05 mg adrenaline were administered through the central venous catheter, followed by rapid volume resuscitation using crystalloid (1 L infusion within 30 min).The dose of noradrenaline was increased to 0.3 μg/kg/min.Consequently, the airway pressures returned to the original level, but the hypotension persisted.Thereafter, adrenaline was administered via bolus (0.1 mg twice) and continuous infusion (0.1 μg/kg/min); however, the increase in her ABP was minimal.Therefore, 1 mg glucagon was administered intravenously, and her systolic ABP immediately rose to 130 mmHg. An erythematous rash also appeared on her neck with the increase in ABP.Her general condition was stable after the therapeutic interventions.Ventricular pacing was continued because bradycardia with complete atrioventricular block was persistent during the interventions.She was admitted to the intensive care unit under tracheal intubation.Subsequently, the continuous infusion of adrenaline was discontinued, and the continuous infusion of noradrenaline was reduced.We also administered 125 mg methylprednisolone for 3 days.She was extubated 9 h after the onset of anaphylaxis, and circulatory agonists were discontinued the following day.She was discharged without complications on postoperative day 9.Blood tests revealed a total serum tryptase level of 7.3 ng/mL and 1.2 ng/mL at 1 h and 24 h after onset, respectively.We advised the patient to undergo allergy tests, such as skin prick tests or intradermal tests, to identify the cause of anaphylaxis.However, the patient refused these tests because she was elderly and unlikely to undergo surgery under general anesthesia in the future.\\\\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.This report was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Nagasaki University Hospital (Approval number: 21041932).', 'A 38-year-old Middle Eastern male presented to the emergency department with sudden onset dense right hemiparesis, right facial droop and aphasia.His background history included a previous ischaemic stroke 15 months ago treated in a different institution.At that time, he presented with a headache and dysphasia and a CT brain showed a left temporo-parietal infarct.By 6 months later, he had returned to his baseline of full functional independence on treatment with clopidogrel 75 mg once daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily.\\\\nOn this admission, CT brain showed a left M1 occlusion and the patient was treated with intravenous alteplase and thrombectomy.\\\\nHis CT angiogram intracranial confirmed an acute occlusion of the M1 portion of the left middle cerebral artery and revealed two separate foci of soft plaques arising from the posterior wall of the origin of the left and right ICA with accompanying carotid webs on both sides ().His MRA carotids showed a haemorrhagic “plaque” at the origin of the left ICA but no high-grade ICA stenosis or any evidence of dissection ().Axial fat-saturated T1W MRI demonstrated a crescentic hyperintense signal at the posterior aspect of the origin of the left ICA consistent with haemorrhage within the known carotid web ().', 'A 3-month-old Japanese boy was admitted because of poor body weight gain, vomiting, and fever that had persisted for one week.He was born as a full-term infant with no complications during pregnancy.\\\\nAt the time of admission, he had polyuria with a urine volume of 700–800 mL/d.Results of laboratory examinations are shown in .Findings of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal.', 'A 60-year-old female patient with a medical history of hypertension came to our attention because of several neurological deficits that had developed over the last few years, significantly impairing her daily life.Four years earlier, she developed sudden weakness and hypoesthesia of the right hand.The symptoms resolved in a few days and no specific diagnostic tests were performed.Two months later, she developed hypoesthesia and weakness of the right lower limb.On neurological examination at the time, she had spastic gait, ataxia, slight pronation of the right upper limb and bilateral Babinski sign.Brain MRI showed extensive white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), so leukodystrophy was suspected.', 'A 29-year-old male, HIV-positive since 2015, severely immunosuppressed that was lost to follow-up before starting ART.He presented in March 2019 at the emergency room (ER) with a one-day history of fever, shortness of breath and cough without providing information about his HIV status.Initial assessment showed polypnea of 30 cycles per minute (cpm), hypoxia, fever (39 °C), elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and bilateral middle and lower zone air space opacities on chest X-ray.He was admitted to the ward and started empirical treatment for community acquired pneumonia (CAP).Two days later, he was transferred to the ICU with aggravated tachypnea (50 cpm), severe hypoxemia (paO2 49 mmHg) despite oxygen supplementation and pneumomediastinum, bilateral pneumothorax and diffuse ground-glass opacities on thoracic-CT scan (a).The CD4+ lymphocyte count was 6/mm3 and the HIV-viral load was 18,200 copies/mL.All other microbiologic tests were negative.Treatment was then switched empirically to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 15 mg/kg of TMP each day in 3 takes plus corticosteroids for a presumed diagnosis of PJP.Later the diagnosis was confirmed by positive immunofluorescence as Pneumocystis jirovecii (P.jirovecii) in bronchoalveolar fluid (BAL).\\\\nDue to refractory hypoxemia and given the high probability of barotrauma, the patient was started on venovenous-ECMO(VV-ECMO) without prior tracheal intubation.He later needed intubation due to poor bronchial clearance of secretions and completed a 14 days-period of protective IMV in an attempt to reduce extra corporeal support.He completed 21 days of therapy with TMP-SMX plus corticosteroids according to recommended PJP treatment dosage (prednisolone 40 mg two times day for 5 days, then 40 mg each day for 5 days and after that 20 mg each day for 11 days).ART was started 15 days after the ICU admission, with a significant reduction in the viral load one month later (151 copies/mL).ECMO and protective IMV were maintained for 40 days, followed by 19 days of weaning off.The pneumomediastinum and bilateral pneumothorax were managed conservatively, and a new CT-scan performed 50 days later showed great improvement (b).He was transferred to the ward after 69 days of ICU stay showing signs of significant myopathy.Three months after discharge, he was revaluated at outpatient care as fully recovered and with CD4+ lymphocyte count improvement (49/mm3).', 'Case 2 was a 1-year-old girl who presented with recurrent hematemesis.She was diagnosed with IPH, and systemic corticosteroids and avoidance of cow’s milk were recommended based on our clinical experience with the first case.However, due to multiple episodes of accidental milk ingestion, she experienced repetitive pulmonary hemorrhage despite corticosteroid therapy.Given the exacerbation of clinical symptoms after milk exposure, she was diagnosed with Heiner syndrome.This case demonstrated the importance of corticosteroid therapy and strict milk restriction.At 2 years after diagnosis, the patient underwent an oral milk provocation test for 5 days, and she showed no symptoms or signs of hemorrhage.', 'Donor 1 was a 6-year-old boy from Guangxi province in China.The initial symptoms on 13 May 2015 were fever of unknown cause with insomnia and refusal to eat or drink.He was sent to a local hospital due to subsequent agitation, screaming and incoherent speech.Three days later, he suffered from dysphagia and hypersalivation.His condition subsequently worsened despite treatment with ribavirin.Finally, he died on 26 May after receiving an initial diagnosis of viral encephalitis of unknown cause (Fig.).Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an opening pressure of 60 drops/min, transparent and limpid fluid, a glucose level of 4.7 mmol/L, and a protein level of 265 mg/L.Computed tomography (CT) revealed a slightly decreased density in the bilateral temporal lobes.Tests for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis yielded negative results.Earlier, the donor had frequent contact with domestic dogs but no longer had this type of exposure since moving to live with his grandmother in another city.His family members denied either exposure to potentially rabid animals or history of rabies vaccinations.His kidneys and corneas were donated for transplantation.\\\\nDonor 2 was an 11-year-old girl who lived in Hebei province in China.Her initial symptoms were nausea, chills and vomiting on 22 Sep 2016.One day later, her condition worsened, and she suffered from fever, disorder of consciousness, coma, respiratory failure and decreased blood pressure, followed by insipidus and myasthenia gravis on 5 Oct.She died on 11 Oct after an initial diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Fig.).The results of CSF analysis were normal.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse signal abnormalities throughout the brain and cervical spinal cord.', 'The patient was a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of liver cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C, tobacco use, and post-stent coronary artery disease, who initially came to the hospital for elective left and right heart catheterization as a pre-transplant evaluation.Physical examination showed abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness with the presence of prominent superficial abdominal veins.A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with contrast was obtained immediately.The CT showed an occlusive thrombus of the IVC extending from the renal veins to the level of the cavoatrial junction.Thrombus was also observed in the portal vein, and multiple subcutaneous varicosities were found.Initially, a plan was made to start the patient on anticoagulation, but because of the patient’s history of advanced cirrhosis, large esophageal varices on recent endoscopy, and thrombocytopenia, we concluded that the patient was not a candidate for anticoagulation.Given that the patient had significant abdominal distention with pain that did not improve even after therapeutic paracentesis; we inserted a stent in the IVC to relieve the patient’s pain as a palliative procedure to improve his quality of life.\\\\nRight internal jugular (IJ) and right femoral vein accesses were obtained for the procedure.A 6F pigtail diagnostic catheter was advanced from the right IJ to the right atrium, and contrast was injected into the right atrium that showed an occluded IVC at the junction of the right atrium.Another pigtail catheter was advanced through the right femoral vein and an inferior venogram was performed that showed the IVC was 100% occluded 2 cm above the renal veins (Figures , ).\\\\nA Glidewire advantage was advanced through the right femoral vein but was unable to cross the 100% occluded IVC.Then, a 7-French Swan-Ganz catheter was tried and was successfully advanced through the IVC all the way to the right atrium.A Swan wire was inserted through the Swan-Ganz catheter.Then, a multipurpose catheter was advanced over the Swan wire into the right atrium, and the Swan-Ganz wire was successfully replaced with a Glidewire Advantage (Figure ).Initially, a 9 × 80 Mustang balloon was used to perform the IVC ballooning; after IVC ballooning; however, the inferior venogram showed no flow to the IVC, which was still 100% occluded.Then, a 22 × 70 mm Wallstent was advanced via the right femoral vein to the right atrial side.The stent was deployed with a considerable waist in the mid area (Figure ).After stent placement, an 18 × 60 Boston Scientific esophageal balloon was successfully used to post-dilate the stent (Figure ).\\\\nThe final venogram (Figures , ) and digital subtraction imaging mode showed excellent flow in the IVC to the right atrium.Small clots floating around at the lower edge of the stent above the renal artery were successfully removed with a 7-Fr snare.Usually, if IVC occlusion is of thrombosis in etiology anticoagulation is advised after venous stent placement, since our patient had an advanced liver failure with elevated INR, anticoagulation was not started [].', 'A previously healthy 25-year-old White man presented with a 1-year history of blurred vision in the right eye, headache, and weight loss of about 30 kg.On physical examination, he had a body mass index of 28 kg/m2 and visual field defects in the right eye.Initial MRI showed a lightly spotted heterogeneous 19 × 16 × 19 mm tumor located suprasellarly, close to the pituitary gland with no ingrowth or association with the pituitary gland (Fig.', 'On July 2008, a 59-year-old man, ex-smoker (45 packs/year), underwent upper right lung lobectomy and regional lymph adenectomy with the diagnosis of stage I (pT2, pN0) lung adenocarcinoma, solid pattern.On July 2020, the chest CT scan revealed the presence of an upper left lung lobe and two lower left lung lobe lesions.On August 2020, the patient underwent a wedge resection of the upper and the lower lung lobes lesions with N1 and N2 nodal sampling.\\\\nGross examination of the surgical specimens of the first atypical pulmonary resection of left inferior lobe revealed an Intraparenchymal, peripheral, solid, yellow-white lesion measuring 1.4 cm in greatest dimension.Histological assessment identified a well-circumscribed lesion composed of two different morphological components, tightly adhered but not intermingled each other.The first component represented about 60% of the whole neoplasm and was characterized by a solid and trabecular proliferation of polygonal-shaped uniform tumor cells, with nuclei with finely granular chromatin and inconspicuocus nucleoli, consistent with carcinoid.Four mitosis/2 mm2 were identified, without tumoral necrosis.The second component, which represented about 40% of whole neoplasm, showed a main lepidic, non-mucinous pattern with secondary papillary architecture, corresponding to a lepidic-papillary pattern PA.Immunoreactivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, and pan-cytokeratins AE1–3 was documented in carcinoid component, while adenocarcinomatous component was positive only for TTF-1 and cytokeratins ().CK7 immunoreactivity was selectively documented in the adenocarcinomatous component.A final diagnosis of “combined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid” was made.No immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 was documented in both components.TPS for PD-L1 was <1% in both components.Both two other lesions on atypical pulmonary resections of the upper left lobe and inferior left lobe showed intraparenchymal neoplasm of 1.8 and 1.5 cm, respectively, corresponding both to PA with a main solid pattern and lepidic, non-mucinous second pattern.A positivity ROS1 score of 2+ with gene rearrangement on FISH was documented in the upper pulmonary lobe neoplasia.No immunoreactivity for ALK and a PD-L1 TPS of 1%–49% were observed.No immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 with PD-L1 TPS of >50% were documented in the lower lobe neoplasia.No pleural invasion was observed.No lymph nodes metastases were found.The final UICC 2017 stage pT4 (m-3) (PL0) pN0 was assigned.\\\\nTargeted NGS analysis on Ion Torrent NGS platform using the Ocav3 panel was performed on DNA and RNA extracted from each microdissected histological components of the primary mixed neoplasm (I1/I2) and in the other two adenocarcinomas located in the inferior (I3) and superior (S1) left pulmonary lobes.Summary of genetic results are shown in \\\\n.Among a total of 161 investigated genes included in the NGS panel, both common and private somatic genes mutations were identified in each entity ().The adenocarcinoma I1 and carcinoid I2 components of the mixed neoplasm shared the same mutations in BRAF (p.Gly466Ala), NF1 (p.Pro1359LeufsTer19 and p.Glu1928Ter), STK11 (p.Gly188AlafsTer99), and AKT2 (p.Leu52Ter) genes.Four additional somatic mutations were detected in the DDR2 (p.Arg806Ter), CDK6 (p.Thr107Ser), and SMARCA4 gene (p.Arg1135Gln) were identified in the adenocarcinoma component, whereas no specific mutations were identified in the carcinoid component.A different genetic profile emerged from the molecular analysis of the two additional adenocarcinoma nodules I3 and S1, lacking those somatic mutations identified in the mixed nodules, but shared two somatic missense mutations in the KRAS (p.Gly12Asp) and NOTCH1 (p.Pro498Arg).In addition, the I3 adenocarcinoma showed a specific, somatic mutations in ATM (p.Gln1117Ter), TP53 (p.Gly245Asp), and CDK12 (p.Arg44Trp) genes, whereas the S1 adenocarcinoma showed a specific, somatic, missense mutations in IDH2 gene (p.Arg172Ser).\\\\nSince November 2020, considering the ROS1 positivity, the patient started crizotinib, which is still ongoing, reporting a stable disease.', 'A 44-year-old Caucasian woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) diagnosed at age 30 and stage IV lung adenocarcinoma treated with 5 cycles of nivolumab (3 mg/kg, every 2 weeks) developed several days of progressive altered mental status, nausea, and vomiting.She then presented to the emergency department following a first time seizure.Upon initial evaluation, she exhibited abnormal tongue movements, inappropriate laughter, and rhythmic movements of her right arm that improved with lorazepam.\\\\nAn electroencephalogram revealed left temporal slowing and frequent interictal discharges.Brain MRI with and without gadolinium demonstrated T2 signal hyperintensities of the bilateral mesial temporal lobes compatible with limbic encephalitis.', 'A 15-year-old male patient presented to the neurology department at our institution with severe Tourette syndrome and comorbid anxiety and depression.The patient’s parents reported that tic onset had occurred when the patient was 9 years of age, when the patient began to exhibit a vocal tic (throat grunting).Motor tics developed at 11 years of age.The tics had worsened over the following three years, at which point the patient developed coprolalia.The patient presented to our movement disorders clinic with severe coprolalia and near-continuous simple and complex motor tics.The patient’s tics were noted to significantly limit his activities of daily living, including self-feeding, self-care, social interaction, and school attendance.Attempts to type were unsuccessful, resulting only in repeated hits to the keyboard interrupted by motor tics.At the time of the initial consultation, the patient had been unable to attend school for over 8 months.He ex-pressed significant feelings of isolation and previous suicidal ideation 6 months prior to consultation.The patient displayed occasional self-injurious tic behavior, including lip/tongue biting and hitting himself in the arm and/or chest.Coprolalia was suggestible and triggerable, with frequency greater than 1/min, concurrent with complex motor tics.\\\\nMultiple attempts at medical therapy included trials of escitalopram, benztropine, clonazepam, clonidine, sertraline, haloperidol, risperidone, guanfacine, and aripiprazole, all of which failed to decrease tic frequency for more than 4 weeks, at any dose administered.Escalation rate, maximum dose, duration, and concomitant medications were adjusted carefully to ensure that the failure of medical therapy was confirmed by an adequate medication trial.After treatment with a single dose of haloperidol, the patient had an acute dystonic reaction requiring hospitalization.Dystonia at that time was diagnosed by a pediatric movement disorder specialist (TDS) based on published criteria [,].Haloperidol treatment was discontinued, and dystonia was resolved.\\\\nGiven his lack of response to multiple medications and the severity of symptoms pre-venting activities of daily living including education, DBS surgery was discussed with the patient and his family.Since the optimal DBS target for Tourette syndrome is not known, we recommended use of a staged procedure with implantation of test leads at multiple possible targets [].The patient and his family consulted with neurosurgery (JKC, MAL) and elected to proceed with implantation of temporary depth electrodes at 12 sites and an anticipated hospitalization for testing of approximately 4–7 days.The presurgical work-up included neuroimaging and laboratory studies, which demonstrated no abnormalities or contraindications to surgical intervention.The patient’s mental health counselor expressed no contraindications.He was off all medications at the time of testing.', 'An otherwise healthy 15-year-old girl presented with a one-day history of generalised abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.An abdominal examination found pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant.An abdominal US showed findings consistent with acute complicated appendicitis.A SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test was positive.The patient was initially treated conservatively for acute uncomplicated appendicitis with IV antimicrobial treatment (ampicillin plus metronidazole), but abdominal pain advanced, blood inflammation markers elevated, and therefore treatment was converted to surgery.It is possible this patient already had acute complicated appendicitis on ED admission.', 'A 71-year-old male presented with a two-week history of painless right submandibular swelling that was not associated with fever.The patient had underlying hypertension and diabetes mellitus that were regularly treated.\\\\nOn examination, a right submandibular swelling with normal overlying skin measuring 6 × 5 cm that was non-tender, mobile, and firm in consistency was noted (Figure , ).The swelling is ballotable by bimanual palpation.There was no other swelling palpable in the neck region.Intraorally, pus was noted at the Wharton’s duct orifice, and no sialolith was palpable.\\\\nPreoperative blood investigations (complete blood count, serum urea and electrolytes, and serum uric acid), electrocardiography, and chest radiographs were normal.Computed tomography (CT) of the neck was performed as part of the preoperative assessment, which showed opacity in the right submandibular gland and duct (Figure , , ).A diagnosis of right submandibular stone was made.The patient subsequently underwent excision of the right submandibular gland under general anesthesia.Intraoperatively, the right submandibular gland was indurated (Figure ).During the excision, the surgeon noted another firm bulge along the submandibular duct that turned out to be a few smaller pieces of stones within the duct (Figure ).The size of the largest stone was 25 mm.Postoperative recovery was uneventful.Histopathology examination revealed severe acute-on-chronic sialadenitis with multiple calculi.', 'A 54-year-old man with a history of excessive intake of alcohol (100 g/day × 30 years) and locally grown tobacco use (500g/month × 30 years) was admitted to our hospital because of chronic persistent swallowing dysfunction for six months.White light endoscopy (WLE) revealed a 22 mm flat lesion in the middle esophagus.The lesion was covered with scattered leukoplakia, and normal vascular network could not be seen in the lesion (Fig.a).Narrow-band imaging (NBI) under endoscopy revealed the lesion with an indistinct brownish area, local white penniform area, and white tiny papillary surface structure (Fig.b).Further low and high magnifying endoscopy with NBI (ME-NBI) showed tiny irregular papillary microsurface structure with various shapes and sizes, and non-typical type B1 pattern of intraepithelial papillary capillary loops (IPCL) confined to the papillary microsurface structure (Fig.c, low magnification, and Fig.d, high magnification) according to the classification of Japan Esophagus Society (JES classification) [].Iodine staining endoscopy revealed a less-stained lesion (Fig.e) and showed more distinct white tiny papillary surface structure (Fig.f) than conventional WLE.Biopsy showed a low grade intraepithelial neoplasia.Chest and abdominal CT scan revealed no abnormal lesions.\\\\nAccording to the endoscopic manifestations under WLE, ME-NBI, and iodine staining endoscopy, combining with pathology, we considered the lesion to be early esophageal cancer.Therefore we chose endoscopic therapy.The lesion was completely resected with endoscopic submucosal dissection.Histopathology showed that the layer of neoplastic spinous cells was significantly thickened (Fig.a) with local keratosis presenting the appearance of the so-called church spire (Fig.b).The lamina propria papilla was elongated upward to the surface layer (Fig.c), and the nuclei in the basal region had double or more nucleoli.Tumor cell displayed expanding growth, and partial tumor cells broke through the basement barrier and invaded into superficial lamina propria (Fig.d).The IPCL were observed in lamina propria papilla with elongating upward to the surface layer growing underneath the layer of neoplastic spinous cells, which corresponds to the IPCL observed by ME-NBI (Fig.e).The lesion was histopathologically confirmed as early VCCE which was limited within the mucosal lamina propria (m2) and completely resected.There were no lymphovascular and neural invasions of cancer cells, and no cancer cells to be seen in the lateral and vertical margin of the resected specimen (the distance of the lesion to the closest margin of the resected specimen was 3.012mm) (Fig.).', 'A 71-year-old African American female with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and osteoarthritis initially presented to the emergency room with intermittent bilateral hand tingling and numbness, which was gradual in onset over months.Her symptoms were associated with seeing red spots and experiencing a burning sensation in the bottom of her feet.She was concerned because she was having difficulty picking up objects due to her hand symptoms.Her basic lab work was unremarkable, and she was provided gabapentin and magnesium oxide with close follow-up with her primary care physician.At follow-up, she complained of one to two months of unsteady gait as well as increased confusion.Her reported medications included losartan and metformin.Physical exam revealed normal pupils with reaction and accommodation (3mm diameter bilaterally), no cranial nerve deficits, normal strength throughout, and normal reflexes throughout except for diminished reflexes in the bilateral knees and ankles.She endorsed blurry vision; no ophthalmologic exam was performed, but she was able to read a name badge from one foot away.She additionally was found to have decreased vibratory and proprioception in a stocking pattern as well as a wide-based and unsteady gait.\\\\nTo investigate further, tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), folate, B12, and rapid plasma regain (RPR) titer were ordered.Her TSH, folate, and B12 levels were within normal limits, but her RPR titer was reactive at 1:1.A subsequent reflex Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test was reactive.She was told to go to the hospital for further workup and treatment.Further questioning revealed that she had had two sexual partners in her life, both ex-husbands.However, she noted that her husbands committed adultery several times and that she was not currently sexually active; her last sexual encounter occurred several years ago.She endorsed that she did not notice any ulcers or skin lesions, and she had not been treated for syphilis.During hospitalization, she received a lumbar puncture that revealed a negative venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test result.Her glucose level (61 mg/dL) and white blood cell level (3 x 109/L) were normal, but her CSF protein level was markedly elevated at 156 mg/dL.Due to her exposure history, a constellation of symptoms, RPR titer with positive TP-PA, and protein elevation in her CSF, our infectious disease colleagues believed that she contracted syphilis earlier in life from one of her husbands and was never treated.The decision was made to start treatment with intravenous (IV) penicillin (24 million units, continuous infusion) for two weeks.At follow-up, her vision had improved and she no longer had sensory symptoms in her hands.Her gait was somewhat improved, but still unsteady, and she still had burning pain in her feet.Her physical exam showed improvement in sensation in hands and improved gait; all other neurological exam was unchanged.It was thought that neuropathy in feet could have been due to poorly controlled diabetes; although, no formal nerve conduction study was pursued.', 'A previously healthy 75-year-old woman presented to her local hospital with a fractured right hip after suffering a fall at home.She was neurologically intact before the fall and denied any history of syncope or lower limb weakness.The following day (Day 2), a right hip hemiarthroplasty was performed.The procedure was uneventful.Soon after the surgery, the patient experienced deterioration of her respiratory status which required biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP).Chest X-ray was unremarkable.The patient was noted to have a urinary tract infection on admission and given ceftriaxone.Doxycycline was added empirically for possible community-acquired pneumonia.The following morning (Day 3), the patient was noted to have decreased responsiveness for which she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).Dilaudid was discontinued in light of this worsening drowsiness.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed subacute ischemia in the left basal ganglia and chronic small vessel ischemic disease (Day 3).\\\\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) on Day 4 demonstrated focal slowing with sharp bitemporal spikes.', 'Patient 1 was a 45-year-old right-handed woman, who sought treatment for a depressive episode.The current episode onset was placed after a switch from sertraline to vortioxetine due to unbearable side effects (nausea and headache).She suffered from her first depressive episode at the age of 25, then alternating depressive and hypomanic episodes, which led clinicians to a diagnosis of BD-II.\\\\nThe patient has also been suffering from EDs since her adolescence: she was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa at the age of 13; she then shifted to a bulimic eating pattern, with binge episodes followed by purging behaviors.This phase lasted for 10 years, followed by a complete remission until the age of 38.At this age she developed BED.Once a week or more she used to wake up at night and eat everything she could find in the fridge, including raw food.After these episodes she used to feel guilty and nauseated, but she did not show purging behavior anymore.She felt very uncomfortable due to either the loss of control or her weight gain.Her private psychiatrist then diagnosed her with BED, but apparently, she did not receive any psychological or pharmacological specific support.In the following years she had alternating periods of remission with periods of active disease.She denied alcohol or other psychoactive substances consumption.In the 2 months previous to our study, she had gained 12 kg, with 3–4 binge episodes per week on average.She denied medical comorbidities.When she first came to our attention, her therapy was the following: lamotrigine (150 mg daily), vortioxetine (20 mg daily).She was suffering from a depressive episode defined as mild according to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and moderate according to the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) ().', 'A 19-year-old female patient with a few days history of severe headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and syncope was admitted for cranial CT examination.Her physical and neurological examinations were normal and her medical history was unremarkable.The color Doppler sonography revealed absence of the right ICA and a changing flow pattern of common carotid artery, from a low peripheral resistance pattern proximally into a high peripheral resistance pattern similar to that seen in the external carotid artery distally (Figure ).The brain CT showed absent right ICA and bony carotid canal without any intraparanchymal pathology (Figure ).MRI and MR angiography findings showed right ICA agenesis and as well as anomalous origin of the ophthalmic artery derived from right middle cerebral artery (MCA).', 'A 60-year old man was admitted to the hospital after falling off an electric scooter.He fell on outstretched hands and knees and did not sustain a head injury.He immediately noticed loss of sensation in all four limbs and the abdomen.\\\\nOn admission to the emergency department, he did not have motor or sensory (light touch or pain) deficits on physical examination.Deep tendon reflexes were intact.Deep anal pressure was intact.Anal tone was preserved with normal voluntary anal contraction.Computed tomography (CT) brain at that time did not show any evidence of fracture or haemorrhage.\\\\nHowever, on review 2 hours later, wrist flexion and extension were noted to have dropped to a power of 2/5, and his grip 3/5 based on the Medical Research Council (MRC) manual muscle testing scale.He was also complaining of a tingling sensation throughout his body.Anal tone and sensation remained normal.The neurological level of injury was C5 ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) D based on the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury.Please see .CT cervical spine showed multilevel cervical spondylosis with marginal osteophytosis and uncovertebral hypertrophy.There was mild central canal stenosis noted at C6/7 and bilateral exit foramina narrowing.\\\\nHe was admitted for observation.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine confirmed the presence of severe cervical spondylosis causing cord compression at C4/5 with associated cord oedema.', 'Patient A, a 43-year-old woman, presented to the neurologist with increased difficulty swallowing and speaking, stiffness in the jaw muscles, and weight loss.Previous history reveals partial thyroidectomy (unknown cause), hypothyroidism, and an episode of atrial fibrillation due to overcompensated hypothyroidism.On clinical examination, there was a myotonic handshake, myopathic facial expression, and a positive Gower’s sign (weakness of the proximal muscles).Electromyography showed frequent myotonic discharges.Electrocardiography was normal.A barium study of the hypopharynx showed decreased motility of the hypopharynx and a deficient closing of the upper gastrointestinal sphincter.\\\\nAn MRI of the brain showed multifocal T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities, with beginning confluence (Fazekas grade 1–2) located in the periventricular white matter and in the subcortical white matter of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes (anteromedial).', 'The second patient died was a 39-year-old female with univentricular heart (tricuspid atresia), who had had previously two cardiac surgeries (the last was atrio-pulmonary Fontan, 33 years earlier).The patient suffered from a serious right atriomegaly with frequent episodes of atrial tachycardia, so she was a candidate for Fontan conversion surgery.Pre-operative ventricular function was mildly reduced (50%).In the post-operative, the patient suffered from severe single ventricle dysfunction resulting in LCOS and the need for ECMO implantation.Both patients could not be weaned from ECMO due to multi-organ failure.\\\\nSeven patients required pace-maker implantation due to post-operative sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular conduction abnormalities.All patients were discharged on oral antiarrhythmic for 3–6 months and anticoagulants for 6 months.At discharge, 15 patients were in sinus rhythm, 5 had a stable pacemaker rhythm, 2 had atrial fibrillation, and 1 atrial flutter.One patient discharged in sinus rhythm had a pacemaker implant 5 months after the operation due to the presence of sinus node dysfunction.\\\\nDuring a median follow-up of 14 months (IQR 7–27), there was no late mortality and 17/23 patients had an improvement of NYHA functional class.Five patients in NYHA III progressed to class II and 4 to class I; eight patients progressed from class II to class I.\\\\nAt follow up electrocardiogram, 16 patients were in sinus rhythm, 6 with stable pacemaker rhythm, and 1 with permanent atrial fibrillation.\\\\nRecurrence of arrhythmia occurred in 2/23 (8.6%) patients, more than 3 months after surgery.These patients presented at surgical ablation with history of atrial fibrillation lasting 4 and 19 years, respectively, and both had atrial fibrillation, which was treated with right-sided Maze rather than Cox maze III due to technical issues.Sixteen (69%) patients are in stable sinus rhythm, 12 without any anti-arrhythmic therapy.At median follow up of 14 months (IQR 7–27), freedom from recurrence of arrhythmia was 90.9% and cumulative risk of recurrence was 9.6% ().', 'A 57-year-old retired male presented in 2019 to Al-Bairouni Hospital complaining of a mass in his left breast.He is a non-smoker, with a history of grade (I) LP in the right thigh root 14 years ago which was treated surgically along with radiotherapy of the right thigh, with no signs of recurrence.He also had well-controlled diabetes.The physical examination showed a left breast mass with a suspicious abnormality on Ultrasound that measured 32 mm.The computed tomography scan (CT) showed left breast infiltration with no signs of metastases.The patient underwent an excisional biopsy which revealed a poorly differentiated grade III invasive ductal carcinoma ().Then he underwent a mastectomy in 2019 with axillary node resection.The final diagnosis based on the histological findings was invasive ductal carcinoma stage IIA [T:2, N:0, M:0].Hormonal receptors tests showed the following: positive Estrogen Receptor (ER+), negative Progesterone Receptor (PR-), and negative Human Epidermal Receptor (HER-) ().He received eight cycles of chemotherapy with Docetaxel and 16 sessions of radiation to the chest wall; The last one was on the fourth of October 2020.A positron emission tomography (PET) scan six months after the surgery showed no signs of recurrence ().', 'A two-year-old female, previously healthy and normally developing, presented with a six-week history of macrocephaly and truncal and peripheral ataxia.An eye examination showed a lack of papilledema but was suspicious for mild peripheral loss of vision.Her past medical history was unremarkable.She did not have diencephalic syndrome at presentation.An urgent brain MRI demonstrated the presence of a large lobulated multicompartmental supra-sellar mass centered within the hypothalamus/optic chiasm (5.4cm x 3.4cm x 5cm) (Figure ), with extension into the surrounding structures and mass effect on the midbrain and third ventricle causing obstructive hydrocephalus.', 'The patient was a 28-year-old woman, Gravida 2 Parity 1 Live Birth 1, who presented at 38 weeks of gestation with epigastric pain radiating to her back with a history of recent travel and symptoms of subjective fevers with a new sense of smell and taste disorders for 1 week.The patient had received regular prenatal care, and her past obstetric history was uncomplicated, with one full-term vaginal delivery.She was overweight (body mass index = 25.7) and had no significant past medical history and drug history.', 'The second case is a 75-year-old Irish woman with a psychiatric history of bipolar affective disorder, stable for several years on olanzapine and valproate, enabling her to lead an independent lifestyle.There was no history of cognitive impairment.She suffered from multiple medical conditions including: atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and a recent mitral valve repair complicated by postoperative delirium.\\\\nShe was admitted medically to a rural Irish hospital in November 2015 for management of a raised INR.During the admission she developed sudden onset left-sided weakness and altered levels of consciousness, as well as rigidity and one isolated temperature spike.The concern was raised that she may be or might have been suffering from neuroleptic malignant syndrome and her neuroleptics were stopped as a precaution (Table ).She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the MMUH in Dublin with a suspicion of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or encephalopathy.Computed tomography (CT) brain imaging was normal at the time.As neuroleptic malignant syndrome was suspected, olanzapine was stopped.However, her creatinine kinase levels were normal as was her body temperature.Hence, neuroleptic malignant syndrome was deemed to be unlikely.An electroencephalogram during admission showed changes suspicious of encephalopathy and MRI imaging showed no acute abnormality.', 'A 21-year-old Danish man diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescence, which was currently untreated, was involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric ward by the police in an agitated and aggressive state after a violent conflict with his parents.Clinically, the patient’s state was compatible with acute intoxication, and the patient confirmed “drug intake,” but quantification could not be specified at admission.Eight months prior, the patient had spent 2 weeks in deep propofol sedation at an intensive care unit (ICU) with acute organic delirium due to GHB withdrawal.\\\\nAt the psychiatric ward, the patient’s threatening and aggressive behavior intensified.To avoid violent incidents, the patient was subjected to physical restraint (abdominal belt) and tablet lorazepam 4 mg was administered twice.The patient was disorientated, started expressing paranoid ideas, and developed diaphoresis, tachycardia (heart rate 130 beats per min), and hyperthermia (37.8 °C, tympanic).Because he started biting the metal locks on his abdominal belt, his hands and feet were also restrained.\\\\nOn the second day, the patient was diagnosed with acute organic delirium caused by GHB withdrawal and treatment was initiated.In accordance with ICD-102, the diagnosis was based upon the clinical presentation in combination with a history of GHB substance abuse.The patient was treated with a cumulative dose of 300 mg diazepam (40 mg as oral administration and 260 mg intravenously), without induction of sleep.To obtain sedation the restrained patient was transferred to the ICU, where he was intubated and sedated with intravenous infusions of propofol (up to 16 mg/kg/hour) and sufentanil (up to 100 μg/hour).\\\\nOn days 3–6, the patient remained deeply sedated and on mechanical ventilation.To counteract potential withdrawal symptoms, clonidine 225 μg was administered every 6 hours via a nasogastric tube (NG tube), intravenous diazepam 20 mg every 5 hours, and continuous midazolam infusions (up to 1 mg/kg/hour).To prevent Wernicke encephalopathy, intravenous thiamine 200 mg and vitamin B 2 ml solution were given.Due to elevated C-reactive protein (64 mg/L) and white blood cell count (leukocytes 12.2 × 109/L; neutrophils 9.1 × 109/L), empiric treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam 4 g every 6 hours was initiated.\\\\nOn day 6, a first wake-up call was attempted.However, upon awakening the patient was disoriented and severely agitated, and he was readily reintubated and resedated.The psychopharmacological treatment was intensified with olanzapine 20 mg/day (via NG-tube), intravenous diazepam 40 mg every 5 hours, clonidine 225 μg every 6 hours (via NG-tube), and continuous midazolam infusions (up to 1 mg/kg/hour).\\\\nOn days 7–9, the intravenous diazepam was increased to 60 mg every 5 hours, and to supplement the propofol sedation, methadone 10 mg twice a day (via NG-tube) was initiated.\\\\nOn day 10, a second wake-up was attempted.Again, the patient was disoriented, reported of ants crawling in the room, and presented with severe agitation.Physical restraints were reinstated and intravenous haloperidol 30 mg/day was added.\\\\nOn day 11, the psychiatrists decided to initiate bilateral frontotemporal ECT as “en bloc” treatment, that is ECT on three consecutive days.Medication status during the three en bloc ECTs was: olanzapine 20 mg twice a day (BID, via NG-tube), methadone 10 mg BID (via NG-tube), intravenous phenobarbital 100 mg every 4 hours, pregabalin 150 mg BID (via NG-tube), haloperidol 5 mg as needed (PRN), up to 50 mg a day, clonidine 225 mg every 6 hours (via NG-tube), and continuous infusions of midazolam (up to 1 mg/kg/hour).Because treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines with long half-lives could compromise seizure induction, the starting ECT dose was set at the maximal energy of 200% (1008 mC) along with intravenous flumazenil 0.4 mg.The ECT series are shown in Fig..\\\\nOn day 12, the first ECT was administered (ECT #1A).Due to an administrative error, flumazenil was not administered, and restimulation with concurrent flumazenil was performed (ECT #1B).After ECT, the patient remained awake although clinically unchanged.\\\\nOn day 13, the second ECT was administered (ECT #2).Subsequently, the patient’s level of agitation decreased, he briefly responded adequately to verbal communication and sleep improved.\\\\nOn day 14, the third ECT (ECT #3A) was administered.Due to seizure at threshold level, restimulation after hyperventilation was performed (ECT #3B).The patient was less agitated and engaged in brief conversations.Haloperidol was increased to 20 mg every 6 hours.On day 15, 50 mg hydroxyzine once a day (QD) was added.\\\\nOn day 16, agitation had completely subsided, restraints were removed, and the patient cooperated with the remaining treatment.\\\\nOn day 17, the fourth ECT was administered (ECT #4).On day 18, the patient displayed no neurological or psychiatric symptoms, all sedatives and psychopharmacological treatment were discontinued, and he was transferred to a general internal medicine ward.\\\\nOn day 19, the patient was still in complete remission, and he insisted on discharge.Upon discharge the patient confirmed daily use of GHB and cocaine prior to hospitalization, and he provided oral and written consent to report his case in the medical literature.Since this is a case report, ethical approval was waived according to Danish regulations.', 'Case 3: A 58-year-old man presented with recurrent headache, transient loss of consciousness (LOC), and progressive memory loss.Eight years before admission, his symptoms began with recurrent headache and transient LOC.Lumbar puncture revealed increased opening pressure, pleocytosis, elevated protein level, and reduced glucose level.He was diagnosed with possible tuberculous meningitis and given empirical anti-tuberculous treatment for more than 1 year.Six years ago, he was admitted with the same symptoms and diagnosed with possible cryptococcal meningitis, for which he received fluconazole for more than 6 months and amphotericin B for 1 month.Three months before admission, he developed progressive memory loss.On admission, brain MRI showed an enhanced lesion posterior to the medulla (Figures ) and hydrocephalus (Figure ).', 'A 71-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to Toranomon hospital because of reduced consciousness.She had a history of a mastectomy for right breast cancer.Eight months before admission, she came to our hospital because of partial paralysis of her right hand.A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass in the left upper lobe, as well as mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy.Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple brain metastases.', 'A 67-year-old man with chief complaints of macrohematuria and an abnormally low hemoglobin level (4.8 g/dL; normal range, 13.7-16.8 g/dL) was referred to our hospital.His performance status was zero and none of any co-morbidities were identified.Whole-body computed tomography (CT) revealed left hydronephrosis, a bladder tumor on the right lateral wall, and right external iliac LN involvement (Figure ).CT revealed a bladder tumor with invasion of surrounding fibroadipose tissue on the right lateral wall (Figure ).Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed after blood transfusion; histopathological diagnosis revealed high-grade UC of the bladder with muscle layer invasion.BCa was classified as clinical T3bN1M0 according to the staging system defined in the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual [].His estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 64.57 mL/min and his renal function was maintained at a normal eGFR level during the medication for BCa. He received two combined courses of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC; 1,000 mg/m2 gemcitabine on days 1, 8, and 15, and 70 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 2) every 21 days.To monitor the treatment effect on BCa, the patient underwent whole-body CT and pelvic MRI after every two courses of systemic therapy.\\\\nAfter two courses with GC, CT revealed left external iliac LN involvement as a new lesion, although the BCa and right external iliac LN decreased in size.', 'A 70-year-old man, with no previous medical history, was admitted to our hospital due to impaired consciousness.On arrival at our emergency department, his airway was patent and the respiratory rate was 30 times/min.His eyes were open but appearing horizontal nystagmus.The oculocephalic reflex was negative at both sides.He did not react to any induced, painful stimulation and flexed his limbs involuntarily.His elbow and knee joints were spastic, but he did not have obvious paralysis or any sensory disturbance.His blood pressure was 230/165 mm Hg upon admission.A blood chemistry analysis showed hypernatremia (160 mEq/L) and severe kidney injury with azotemia (blood urea nitrogen was 198.9 mg/dL).An arterial blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.An echocardiogram revealed concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with normal wall motion with hypovolemia.A cranial computed tomography (CT) image obtained on the day of admission demonstrated abnormal low-density areas in the basal ganglia, midbrain, thalamus, and both sides of the cerebral white matter.He was treated with drip infusion of a calcium channel blocker, and his blood pressure was controlled to 149/88 mm Hg within 5 hours.\\\\nA brain MRI obtained on day 2 demonstrated hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white matter, cerebellum, and brainstem.', 'A seven-and-a-half-year-old male child was sent to our Pediatric Endocrinology Centre for macrocephaly and right lateralized overgrowth, reported from birth.Parents were not related and no noteworthy diseases were reported in his family history.The pregnancy was characterized by spontaneous abortion of the dizygotic twin at 16 gestational weeks.Fetal ultrasounds were normal.He was born at 35 weeks of gestational age by an emergency caesarean section for acute fetal suffering.Birth weight was 3010 g (1.65 standard deviations [SD]), birth length was 51 cm (2.45 SD) and birth occipito-frontal circumference (OFC) was 36 cm (2.93 SD).\\\\nThe perinatal period was characterized by hospitalization because of the mild prematurity, neonatal jaundice treated with phototherapy and the findings of hypotonia.In his first months of life he presented a progressive increase of the OFC and was submitted to brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and to neurosurgical evaluation, which permitted an initial diagnosis of isolated benign macrocephaly.', 'A 49-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension, preeclampsia, anxiety, and bipolar disorder on buspirone, presented to the emergency department with triage complaint of “multiple complaints”.Her history of present illness revealed a persistent headache that initially started one week prior to arrival.The patient recalled onset in the evening associated with nausea and vomiting.She went to an urgent care the next day and received medications, after which she felt better for about two days.When her symptoms recurred, she went to an outside hospital where she had a computed tomography scan of the head and lumbar puncture, both of which were negative.The patient was admitted for an elevated troponin level and received a cardiac catheterization without intervention, findings significant for 60% blockage of a single vessel.The patient presented to us one day post discharge due to persistent headache.She described the headache as similar to her prior preeclampsia headache, feeling \"like a grip around\" her entire head.\\\\nHer initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 172/92 mmHg, pulse 81, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air.A physical exam revealed a woman in pain but nontoxic appearing.Her heart and lung sounds were normal.Her neurological exam was unremarkable with no focal numbness, weakness, or abnormalities with coordination, gait, or cranial nerves.The chest plain film, initial lab, and electrocardiogram results were normal.\\\\nThe patient received one liter intravenous fluids, metoclopramide intravenous, and ketorolac intravenous with minimal improvement and still appeared uncomfortable on multiple reassessments.The patient was placed in the observation unit and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was ordered.\\\\nThe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed three punctate regions of focal restricted diffusion in the left middle frontal gyrus, right parietal lobe, and left temporal lobe that appeared consistent with acute infarcts.', 'A 54 yr old man from Southwest of Iran (Yasuj) presented to the Emergency Ward with a 3-wk history of headache (continuous, throbbing, and general), fever, chills, weakness, anorexia, and weight loss.He also

artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the left descending artery (LAD) and to the right coronary artery (RCA) 12 years earlier, and myocardial infarction 11 years earlier due to in-stent stenosis.In his past medical history, there was an unclear history of sensory or motor impairment after coccyx cyst surgery.\\\\nAll laboratory data were within normal limits except for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (521st, 1 132nd) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) > 2 mg/l.Echocardiographic findings were left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% and mild left ventricular hypertrophy.Coronary artery CT-angiography was performed and stenosis of three coronary arteries was established.\\\\nThe induction of anaesthesia was performed with Dormicum 5 mg, Propofol 150 mg, Esmeron 60 mg and Sevoflurane.The patient underwent triple coronary artery bypass grafting as follows: left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery (LIMA–LAD), a saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginalis (SVG–OM1) and another saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery (SVG–RCA).During surgery his vital signs were stable and the arterial blood gasses (ABGs) were within normal limits.\\\\nAfter surgery the patient was moved to the cardiac ICU while intubated and unconscious, with a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, heart rate of 77 beats/min and normal sinus rhythm, central venous pressure of 8 cm H2O and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation of 100%.After admission to the ICU, his primary vital signs were normal.The patient was successfully weaned and extubated on the same day.The post-surgery drugs were: enoxaparin 40 mg daily, furosemide 20 mg daily, metoprolol 100 mg twice daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, atorvastatin 20 mg daily and acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg daily.\\\\nOn the first postoperative day, laboratory findings in the ICU were: haemoglobin 10 g/dl, haematocrit 30.5%, platelets = 242 000 cells/l, white blood cell count = 9 100 cells/l, prothrombin time = 15.3 sec, activated partial thromboplastin time = 32 sec, INR = 1.47, sodium = 139 mEq/l, potassium = 4.9 mmol/l, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) = 17 mg/dl, creatinine = 0.94 mg/dl, creatine phosphokinase (CK) = 847 U/l, CK-MB = 58 U/l.He was moved to the cardiac surgery department.During this first postoperative day, the patient was stable, awake and oriented.No signs of haemodynamic instability or cardiac dysrhythmias were seen.\\\\nThe second day after CABG, the overall condition of the patient was good but he had difficulty moving his lower limbs.Neurological consultation was done and the cranial nerves were found to be intact, cerebellar tests and sensory examinations were normal, muscle strength of the lower limbs was 3/5 and symmetric and plantar reflexes were double flexor.\\\\nOn the third postoperative day, the overall condition of the patient was good but he still had difficulty moving the lower limbs.Progressive paraparesis developed and the muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) began to decrease gradually.Paraparesis progressed and muscle strength decreased from 4/5 to 3/5 and then to 2/5.In the evening, severe weakness of the lower and upper limbs developed, absence of DTRs, no plantar reflexes, and muscle strength was 1/5 on the left and 0/5 on the right side.That night the patient presented with respiratory failure; he was intubated and moved to the ICU.\\\\nOn the fourth day, the patient was haemodynamically stable and he was transferred to the radiology laboratory in order to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).', 'An 11-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented for investigation of acute vestibular signs.The owner reported a left sided head tilt and loss of balance observed a few hours prior to presentation.Physical examination was unremarkable while a left-sided head tilt, broad-based pelvic limb stance, and a mild intermittent intention head tremor was observed on neurological examination.Vestibular ataxia with falling to the left, decreased postural reactions in all four limbs (paw positioning, hopping, and extensor postural trust) and bilateral positional vertical nystagmus were also recorded.A left central vestibular syndrome was suspected.\\\\nHematology, biochemistry, fasting bile acids, thyroxine levels, and urinalysis were unremarkable.Feline leukemia virus antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus antibody tests were negative (SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo test; IDEXX, Maine).Systolic blood pressure measured upon admission using Doppler sphygmomanometry was considered within normal limits for a hospital environment (mean reading = 151 mmHg).\\\\nAn MRI study of the brain (0.4T Hitachi Aperto Lucent MR scanner, Tokyo) was performed 24 h after the onset of neurological signs.', 'A 65-year-old woman with a noncontributory medical history was referred to the Oral Surgery Unit, Policlinico Umberto I, “Sapienza” University of Rome, Italy, to undergo surgical reconstructive therapy peri-implantitis lesion localized around the mandibular left distal implant ( and ).The patient’s written detailed informed consent was obtained for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach and the use of the documentation for research purposes and publishing.\\\\nThe procedure involved the prosthetic superstructure removal, oral and buccal full-thickness mucoperiosteal flaps incision, surface debridement and decontamination, and guided bone regeneration of an infra-bony defect using a mineralized dehydrated bone allograft and resorbable membrane in the non-submerged mode of wound healing [].\\\\nDuring open-flap debridement of the infected implant surface with sodium bicarbonate air powder abrasion (PROPHYflex™ 3 with periotip, KaVo, Biberach, Germany) (), rapid onset swelling arose on the left cheek as well as in the periorbital space.The procedure was stopped immediately and the surgical area was rinsed with sterile saline solution to remove all residual bicarbonate particles.Before repositioning and suturing the flap, intra- and extra-oral inspection and palpation of the face and neck were performed to determine the spread and extension of entrapped air.Extra-oral examination revealed slight asymmetry of the face and complete left eyelid ptosis due to swelling of the left periorbital space and cheek ().\\\\nA crackling sensation with no tenderness was detectable on palpation of the subcutaneous tissue in the swelling area.Visual acuity, light reflex, and extraocular movements were intact.Intraoral examination showed no swelling or crepitus in the mandibular region because air, spreading upwards alongside the buccinator muscle insertion, was entrapped into the upper and middle loose spaces of the face.The patient complained of experiencing only slight discomfort but no pain and no difficulty swallowing, breathing, or speaking.Therefore, computed tomography was deemed unnecessary to avoid undue radiation exposure.Subcutaneous emphysema diagnosis was based on the sudden onset during air-powder debridement of soft tissue swelling associated with crepitus in the absence of erythema, oedema, significant pain, or lymphadenopathy.\\\\nIn the lack of signs or symptoms of serious complications, close observation was performed.The patient was reassured that the swelling should reduce spontaneously in 2–3 days and subside within 7–10 days with no complications or morbidity.After an adequate observation period, the patient was discharged with a prescription for 875 mg of amoxicillin plus 125 mg of clavulanic acid (Augmentin; GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) twice daily and 250 mg of metronidazole (Flagyl; Zambon, Milan, Italy) three times daily for ten days.The antibiotic protocol was adopted to prevent the potential aerobic and anaerobic polymicrobial infection due to the dissemination in subcutaneous tissues from peri-implantitis lesion microbiota [].Furthermore, to reduce the probability of complications, the patient was advised to avoid coughing, sneezing, and nose-blowing, which could increase intraoral pressure.\\\\nFollow-up visits were scheduled every two days to monitor the progressive swelling reduction and complete resolution, which was obtained spontaneously after a week without any complications.', 'A 27-year-old non-HIV-infected female was admitted to our hospital because of a headache and the worsening of pre-existing visual disturbance.Her medical history comprised tuberculous meningitis treated with anti-TB drugs (2-month treatment with isoniazid, 300 mg/day; rifampin, 450 mg/day; ethambutol, 1000 mg/day; and pyrazinamide, 1500 mg/day, followed by a 10-month treatment with isoniazid and rifampin) with adjunctive corticosteroid 10 years ago.The Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture was susceptible to all anti-TB drugs, and the patient attained bacteriological remission with a sequela of visual impairment (bilateral counting finger) because of hydrocephalus that was treated with the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt.Although asymptomatic remnant tuberculomas were reported primarily in the bilateral ambient cistern after the completion of the anti-TB treatment (Fig.), her symptoms remained stable, and she visited a neurosurgical clinic regularly to check the patency of the VP shunt.\\\\nUpon admission, the patient was alert and afebrile, and the neurological examination revealed only the worsening of pre-existing visual disturbance from counting finger to light perception without meningeal irritation.The blood analysis revealed a slight elevation in CRP levels (0.37 mg/dL), and the interferon-γ release assay (T-SPOT) was positive.A chest X-ray revealed no abnormal lesions suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis.In addition, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing revealed elevated protein levels (570 mg/dL), no pleocytosis (6/μL), and normal glucose levels (60 mg/dL), with a standard opening pressure (130 mmH2O).Notably, antigens of Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma, and Aspergillus in the CSF and the serum antibody against Taenia solium were all negative, and no elevation of soluble interleukin-2 receptor and the angiotensin-converting enzyme was observed in the CSF.Furthermore, a head CT revealed new emerging tuberculomas in the left sylvian fissure, which was accompanied by a low-density area in the left temporal lobe (Fig.).While a contrast-enhanced axial T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed tuberculomas with a diffuse hypointense area around the left sylvian fissure, brain fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging indicated a hyperintense area around the tuberculomas in the left sylvian fissure, suggesting edematous changes (Fig.', 'A 56-year-old woman of North African origin, with no medical and surgical history, was admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine for investigation of a Raynaud phenomenon evolving for 3 months, associated with inflammatory arthralgias involving the wrists, elbows, and ankles; the patient also reported pain and progressive proximal muscle weakness in her lower limbs when climbing stairs, which extended to the upper limbs.There was no rash.Neuromuscular examination revealed proximal tetraparesis, mild neck flexion, and extension weakness.Strength at the neck was 4/5; at the shoulder 3/5; at the wrist 4/5; at the hips 2/5; and at the ankle 4/5; dorsiflexion/plantar flexion was normal.Tendon reflexes were normal.A few days after her hospitalization, the patient developed slight dysphonia and dysphagia; then this symptomatology was accentuated over time.\\\\nNail fold capillary microscopy was normal.Blood tests showed significant levels of muscle enzymes [creatinine kinase (CK) 40,000 IU/L].Autoimmune screening for myositis-specific and myositis-associated autoantibodies was negative.Electromyography (EMG) showed a decrement in compound muscle action potential on repetitive stimulation and clear signs of myopathy.The diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy was confirmed by muscle biopsy, which showed myositis (Fig.).The patient was treated with prednisone 60 mg daily; we observed a slight improvement in muscle weakness and a significant decrease in CK serum level.\\\\nA month later, she developed intermittent diplopia, ptosis, and mild dysarthria during the conversation.Serum acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies were positive (5.59 nmol/L), and muscle-specific kinase antibodies were negative.A broader workup performed with computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a large anterior mediastinal mass (114 × 57 × 100 mm) (Fig.), which a subsequent biopsy revealed as B1-type thymoma (Fig.).\\\\nInflammatory myositis associated with myasthenia gravis was diagnosed.Pyridostigmine in combination with steroids was started, with significant improvements in generalized weakness, ptosis, and dysarthria.The patient underwent thymectomy as part of the additional treatment.Currently, she is on a low dose of steroids and pyridostigmine and is asymptomatic.The features of myositis have not relapsed.', 'A 30-year-old immunocompetent female patient came with complaints of fever and headache for 1 month associated with vomiting.The patient was evaluated for immune-suppressed states such as diabetes mellitus, AIDS and hepatitis B and C virus infections, and was negative.In view of the fever and headache, a provisional diagnosis of meningoencephalitis was made and CT brain scan with contrast was ordered.CT brain scan with contrast showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions.MRI brain spectroscopy was performed, which showed ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding oedema ().', \"A 35-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for evaluation of 3 months of worsening exertional dyspnea and bilateral lower extremity edema.The patient initially noted mild dyspnea on exertion, which gradually progressed to the point of being unable to climb a single flight of stairs without stopping to rest.The patient endorsed a nonproductive cough, pleuritic chest pain, occasional orthopnea, and an unintentional 20-pound (9.1 kg) weight loss over a one-month period.She denied any associated fevers, chills, or night sweats; had no nausea or vomiting; and had no easy bruising or bleeding.The patient denied any other recent illness and also denied any significant exposures or risk factors for tuberculosis.She had no significant past medical history including any previous cardiac pathology, thromboembolic disease, structural heart disease, indwelling catheters, or asthma.She denied any current or prior intravenous drug use (IVDU).Family and surgical history was also noncontributory.\\\\nPhysical exam demonstrated a nontoxic appearing patient sitting comfortably in bed.Vital signs included a temperature of 98.1°F (36.7°C) with mild tachycardia at 109 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/64 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.Pulmonary examination revealed lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally without adventitious sounds or retractions; however, the patient was only able to speak in 4–5-word sentences with effortless tachypnea and no accessory muscle use.Cardiac examination demonstrated mild tachycardia without murmurs, rubs, or gallops; no jugular venous distention; and no carotid bruits.Extremity examination was notable for symmetric 2+ pitting edema to the midshin of both lower extremities.Skin exam revealed no purpura, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, splinter hemorrhages, or track marks.Abdominal exam was nontender, and neurological examination was nonfocal.\\\\nMultiple laboratory studies including 2 sets of blood cultures were obtained () and remarkable only for mild hyponatremia with a sodium of 127 mEq/L, a chloride of 90 mEq/L, and mild anemia with a hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL.There was no leukocytosis, troponin was undetectable, and brain-natriuretic peptide was within the normal range.These laboratory findings were not suggestive of any particular pathological processes.The finding of anemia was noted, but the lack of any corresponding elevation in bilirubin made acute hemolysis less likely.The hyponatremia was felt to be consistent with the patient's hypervolemic clinical picture.The lack of leukocytosis was noted, though limited inferences can be made from this value in isolation.Overall, the laboratory results made acute decompensated congestive heart failure and bacterial pneumonia lower on the differential.\\\\nA 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with normal axis and intervals, with no acute injury pattern and no evidence of right-heart strain.A chest radiograph was obtained () and was interpreted by the radiologist as demonstrating “bilateral patchy atelectasis”—however, the emergency physicians felt it demonstrated a pleural-based wedge-like consolidation in the right inferior lobe consistent with Hampton's Hump.The initial differential considered by the providers included pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and infectious endocarditis.At this time, a third set of blood cultures were added to the patient's workup.\\\\nA limited bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (Figures and ) in the ED revealed findings concerning for tricuspid valve vegetations as well as a slightly enlarged right ventricle without any D-sign (i.e., a D-shaped left ventricle on parasternal short-axis view, consistent with right ventricular strain causing shift of the ventricular septum).Cardiology was consulted for concern for potential IE.A CT-angiogram (CTA) of the chest was ordered to assess for pulmonary embolism and further characterize the pulmonary lesions seen on radiography, and the patient received intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover possible community-acquired pneumonia while the CTA was pending.The CTA revealed findings consistent with multiple septic emboli and mycotic aneurysms (Figures and ), as well as multiple segmental pulmonary arterial occlusions with associated infarcts or hemorrhage.A stat formal echocardiogram was obtained and interpreted at bedside by the cardiology fellow, confirming the presence of tricuspid vegetations as well as moderate tricuspid regurgitation, with no evidence of right ventricular strain.\\\\nThe patient was treated with IV vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin to provide coverage for possible MRSA endocarditis, due to the concern for possible undisclosed IVDU, and was admitted with consultation of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Infectious Disease (ID).\\\\nThe patient was maintained on IV gentamycin and vancomycin and underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) on hospital day 2 which revealed a large 2.0 × 2.1 cm posterior leaflet tricuspid valve vegetation with severe tricuspid regurgitation.On hospital day 5, the patient admitted to a history of heroin IVDU but was not forthcoming about the date of her most recent use, and a urine toxicologic screen was negative.The patient underwent a tricuspid valve annuloplasty and reconstruction using autologous pericardial tissue by Cardiothoracic Surgery on hospital day 8.The patient's blood cultures remained negative on hospital day 9, at which time ID recommended the patient receive ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for 6 weeks.Pathology of the valve leaflets resulted on hospital day 10 and indicated granulation tissue with focal areas of bacterial colonization without bacterial identification.The remainder of the patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated, and on hospital day 15, she was transferred in good condition to a skilled nursing facility to complete her 6-week course of IV ceftriaxone.The blood cultures remained negative, and the causative pathogen was not identified.\", 'A 57-year-old man with NASH without cirrhosis presented to a satellite hospital with acute onset of painless hematochezia for 1 day.He had unprovoked deep venous thrombosis with a negative hypercoagulable workup and portal-vein thrombosis on Apixaban diagnosed 18 months prior to presentation.He was tachycardic and mildly hypotensive.There was no evidence of chronic liver disease on exam.The hemoglobin level was 130 g/L and subsequently decreased to 80 g/L, while the platelet count was 160 × 109/L.Laboratory tests revealed the following values: INR, 1.13; lactate, 1 mmol/L; albumin, 3.7 g/dl; and liver enzymes were within normal limits.Anticoagulation was discontinued and he was resuscitated using intravenous (IV) crystalloids.Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed small non-bleeding esophageal varices.Colonoscopy revealed a complex ascending colonic varix with active bleeding ().\\\\nHe was treated with IV octreotide at the satellite hospital at which he presented and then transferred to our tertiary institution for escalation of care.Liver-protocol computed tomography (CT) was performed for TIPS evaluation and revealed a steatotic liver and collateralized chronically thrombosed SMV with patent portal vein.He was deemed not to be a candidate for either TIPS or BRTO in the setting of chronic SMV thrombosis.Colonic resection was not recommended, since it was unlikely to prevent future bleeding with significant collaterals.\\\\nHe continued to have hematochezia with Hgb nadir of 78 g/L.A trans-hepatic portogram performed by interventional radiology revealed an elevated absolute portal pressure of 18 mmHg. Digital subtraction images confirmed the site of the SMV occlusion at the confluence of two large SMV branches, in addition to retrograde flow through the large right CV.The occluded SMV was cannulated through a left patent branch using a 4-French angled glide catheter and a stiff Glidewire.A Cobra 2 catheter and a stiff Glidewire were used to cannulate the right SMV branch at the confluence.Recanalization of the occluded SMV () was achieved by using 5 × 40 mm balloon angioplasty to 5 mm, then two overlapping 10 × 40 mm self-expanding stents were successfully deployed into the origin of the right SMV branch, extending proximally into the portal splenic confluence.The stents were then post-dilated using balloon angioplasty to 8 and 10 mm.Follow-up venography showed antegrade flow in the right SMV branch into the SMV stent with a marked reduction in filling of the right CV ().The procedure was terminated after restoration of the SMV flow and the portal pressure was not measured post-procedurally.Liver biopsy showed steatohepatitis with stage 2/4 fibrosis.Apixaban and low-dose aspirin were started.Two months after discharge, the patient had no recurrent bleeding and CT showed patent SMV stents ().A plan for surveillance was determined using cross-sectional imaging every 6 months for 2 years.', 'Patient 2: A 57-year-old male was diagnosed with AML in July 2016.Investigation revealed a pancytopenia.BM examination showed a hypercellular marrow with 65% myeloid blasts.Flow cytometry analysis showed the immunophenotype of myeloid blasts.Cytogenetics revealed del () (q22q36), and a molecular panel identified aberrations in DNMT3A and IDH2.The patient achieved CR after 1 cycle of the IA regimen [idarubicin 12 mg/m2 day1-3, cytarabine 100 mg/m2 continuous infusion day1-7.] and received 6 courses of the HiDAC regimen [cytarabine 2 g/m2 over 3 h every 12 h on day1–3.] as consolidation therapies while not adopting allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.The patient experienced his first relapse 2 years after first remission with a 9% immature cell level in the BM and was treated with the CAG [cytarabine 10 mg/m2 every 12 h, day1-14; aclarubicin 5-7 mg/m2, daily on day1-8; and concurrent use of G-CSF 200 µg/m2/day.] regimen for 3 cycles, resulting in a second CR in March 2019.A second relapse occurred 20 months later.The patient began the VA regimen [venetoclax once daily (100 mg day1, 200 mg day2, 400 mg day3-28) and azacitidine 75 mg/m2 day1-7.], but no response was observed after 2 courses of therapies.Finally, the patient received a chidamide combined with venetoclax plus azacitidine regimen [chidamide 5 mg daily day1-7, venetoclax 100 mg day1, 200 mg day2, 400 mg day3-21; azacitidine 75 mg/m2 daily day1-7.] as salvage therapy as described above.The patient achieved his third CR.Treatment process is shown in .There were no infectious complications observed with the combination, and the duration of neutropenia was 10 days.After 1 month of follow-up, the patient remains in CR and is preparing for transplantation.', 'This 66-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital due to an ischemic left-hemispheric stroke in addition to a dry cough and fever.He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 the following day but continued to deteriorate resulting in severe ARDS, intubation, and ICU admission.Despite repeated proning, gas exchange did not improve sufficiently and the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days.After sedation was stopped, the patient continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or to follow commands.Physical therapy therefore focused on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization.A first SOEB trial had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability.Instead, the patient was positioned in a side-edge position (), which he tolerated better and where an intensive exercise training including trunk and head control was conducted.Nevertheless, muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed again.Physical therapy was also limited because of reduced self-activity and suspected impaired perception and visual acuity.Consequently, occupational therapy was involved to create a basis of communication, to support functional initiation of upper limb movements, and to integrate perception-training into activities of daily living.Currently, the patient tolerates spontaneous breathing trials, shows signs of being alert during therapy, but cannot communicate.He is hemodynamically stable, even in an SOEB position, but remains functionally dependent (CPAx 6/50).', 'A 76-year-old male complained of bilateral progressive hearing loss for approximately 35 years (see ) and recurrent acute hearing loss on both sides.He reported no tinnitus or vertigo.The patient had a profound hearing loss on the left side with an aided WRS of 20% at 65 dB SPL (FMT) and 0% on the right side with bilateral hearing aids.The hearing nerve integrity was tested with an electrode in the external auditory meatus; the patient could hear humming when the amperage of 531 µA was applied.\\\\nCranial MRI performed during evaluation for implantation revealed a multilocular schwannoma on the right side: small IC VS (T1) and a small intracochlear schwannoma (A,B).', 'A 38-year-old male patient, with no relevant medical history, was admitted to the hematology department of the Henri Becquerel Center in Rouen in May 1999 for diplopia with clinical signs of intracranial hypertension.A cerebral CT scan shows left frontal, left parietal, right occipital, and right lateral lesions strongly enhanced after injection of contrast medium with perilesional edema and mass effect on the lateral ventricles.An encephalic MRI is performed which confirms the visible lesions on the initial CT scan.', 'An 11-year-old boy was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease at the age of nine years.Since then, he was on a regular infliximab transfusion regimen at monthly intervals at a dose of 5 mg/kg for maintenance of remission of disease as symptoms relapse by the end of each month.He presented to the Maternity and Children Hospital in Al-Ahsa, Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia, complaining of palpitation for one year.The palpitations were intermittent at the beginning of the year but then worsen progressively over the last month.They were associated with easy fatigability and chest discomfort, with no history of cyanosis or chest pain.There was no history of a similar condition or history of cardiac disease or sudden death in the family.In addition, these symptoms occur with the manifestation of tachycardia during infliximab transfusion with no respiratory or mucocutaneous involvement or other signs of anaphylaxis.This transfusion reaction is managed by slowing the transfusion rate and premedication with steroids and antihistamines.\\\\nUpon examination of the child, he appeared pale, underweight (with weight of 18 kg below the third centile) but not distressed.He had sinus tachycardia (150-160 beats/min) with maintained blood pressure (98/59 mmHg).chest examination revealed hyperdynamic precordium with pan-systolic murmur grade III out of VI at the apex with radiation to left mid-axillary line with no thrill.Rest of the examinations were unremarkable.Laboratory investigations showed microcytic hypochromic anemia related to the drop of iron profile and thrombocytosis, with positive anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies for Crohn’s disease and negative antibodies for infliximab (Table ).ECG and Holter 24 hours monitor were done and showed intermittent sinus tachycardia with no dysrhythmias (Figure ).Echocardiography showed dilated left ventricle with ejection fraction of 21% and fraction of shorting of 10% associated with severe mitral regurgitation (Figure and Video ).The patient was diagnosed with acute heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy.He started on anti-failure medications controlling three parameters pre-load, after-load, and enhancing myocardial contractility by diuretics furosemide (1 mg/kg/dose twice a day initially), spironolactone (1 mg/kg/dose twice a day), enalapril (0.35 mg/kg/day divided three times a day) and digitoxin (2.5 mcg/kg/day once daily), respectively.Aspirin was added as an anticoagulant.In addition, the patient started on intravenous iron to improve anemia which was not responding to oral iron supplementations or dietary management.The patient was discharged home with the previous plan and kept on regular follow-up with pediatric cardiology with no need for cardiac surgery at the present time.In addition, he kept on regular follow up with pediatric hematology to assess the improvement in hemoglobin and response parental iron.Finally, the patient referred to a tertiary hospital for further follow-up with pediatric gastroenterology and the possibility of starting a different anti-tumor necrosis factor agent ustekinumab.', 'A 10-year-old white girl presented to our emergency room in January 2015 with a 1-month history of headache and morning vomiting.On examination, she appeared slightly pale, with body temperature of 36.5 °C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% in ambient air.Her neurological status was normal.Laboratory test results are shown in Table .A chest X-ray was within limits.An urgent non-enhanced brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed a focal lesion in the left frontal subcortical region with prominent surrounding edema and mass effect (Fig.).She was therefore admitted to our hospital.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated ring enhancement on post-contrast T1-weighted (T1W) sequences; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences confirmed extensive vasogenic edema (Fig.', 'A 63-year-old man was admitted to our Respiratory Disease Unit at the University Hospital—Ancona, for a 6-month exertional dyspnea and bilateral pleural effusion prevalent on the ride side, detected on chest computed tomography (CT).\\\\nHe was former smoker without occupational exposure to asbestos.His medical history was remarkable for asymptomatic brain aneurysm, blood hypertension, multiple lumbar disc herniation.On admission to our unit, physical examination, oxygen saturation on room air, heart rate and blood pressure were normal, whilst breathing sound was suppressed at the third right lower lung fields.\\\\nThe patient first underwent a repeated CT scan that allowed us to rule out a pulmonary embolism and confirmed moderate right pleural effusion with parietal and visceral pleural thickening, in the absence of significant parenchymal abnormalities ().Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) revealed hyperechogenic pleural fluid with atelectasis of basal segments of the right lower lobe (); at thoracentesis, fluid appeared cloudy and yellow coloured, and a physico-chemical exam was consistent with exudate and microbiological tests, including an acid-alcohol-fast bacilli (AAFB) search, were negative ().\\\\nA subsequent medical thoracoscopy (MT) revealed the presence of yellow pleural fluid (overall 1800 mL removed) and parietal pleura hyperemia with fibrotic plaques ().Ten pleural biopsies were obtained by forceps on parietal pleura and histopathological examination documented a large lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, fibrosis, reactive mesothelial cells and vascular proliferation, in absence of neoplastic lesions or granulomas; the final diagnosis was suggestive for non-specific pleuritis (NSP).\\\\nAn extensive diagnostic work-up, including echocardiogram, abdominal angiography CT scan, autoimmune, viral, and bacterial serology, failed to detect any potential known cause of NSP and blood tests were normal, except for a mild elevation of C-reactive protein.Thus, the patient was diagnosed with idiopathic NSP and therapy was started with steroids (Methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg, tapered in one month with clinical and radiological improvement.\\\\nSix months later, the patient complained chest discomfort and mild dyspnea, and CT scan showed a relapse of small amount of right pleural effusion associated with diffuse pleural thickening; a PET-FDG showed slight captation on right basal parietal pleural without abnormal captations in other organs ().\\\\nDue to the limited pleural effusion and the absence of sliding at TUS, we decided not to repeat thoracoscopy, but to refer the patient to the Thoracic Surgery Unit of Sant’ Andrea University Hospital (Rome) for a surgical pleural biopsy.Histological examination revealed a diffuse fibrosing pleuritis, with occasional hyaline features, fibrinous exudate, and a dense lymphocytic and plasma cell inflammation.Interestingly, inflammatory infiltrate was diffuse but with irregular distribution throughout the histological specimen.Immunoperoxidase stains showed a marked increase of IgG4 positive plasma cells (up to 50/HPF) with an IgG4+/IgG+ ratio >40% reaching the diagnostic threshold level for IgG4 disease [].High IgG4 serum levels were found (324 mg/dL) [].Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related pleuritis ().\\\\nAfter exclusion of systemic involvement of IgG4 disease, steroid therapy was started (Prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks, tapering up to 2.5 mg/day as a maintenance dose for an overall period of 6 months) with a complete and stable resolution of pleural effusion, improvement of respiratory symptoms and a progressive reduction of IgG4 serum levels, returned within normal limits (64 mg/dL).', 'On July 2017, a 52 year old Caucasian woman was admitted to our Emergency Department with acute respiratory failure.She had complained in the previous days of drowsiness, apathy and headache.Arterial blood gas determination showed the following values: pH 7.48, pCO2 92.0 mmHg, pO2 58.5 mmHg, B.E. (B) 16 mmol /L, HCO3 42.6 mmol/L, SO2 91.3%.Significant data at clinical history were a former smoking habit and quadrantectomy for breast carcinoma in 2012.In the latest two years she had been followed by a nutritionist for unintentional weight loss.For a long-term history of headache, 3 months before she had undergone to a brain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) found to be normal.Due to depressive symptoms in the latest 12 months, she had been prescribed by a psychiatrist citalopram and then duloxetine without benefits.\\\\nAt hospital admission chest X-ray did not show significant alterations.An electromyographic study was performed, including nerve conduction evaluation, repetitive nerve stimulation, and concentric needle examination (this latter of limited reliability for the effect of sedation on patient’s cooperation).Commonly tested nerves and muscles were explored with normal findings.\\\\nThe whole clinical scenario was interpreted as an exacerbation of chronic ventilatory failure not related to a neurological cause.Actually, the presence of long-standing symptoms such as headache, tremor, drowsiness, psychic alterations were attributed to chronic hypercarbia caused by a broncho-pulmonary disorder.\\\\nIn the following days, a transient clinical improvement allowed to extubate the patient.Distress of accessory muscles with rapid recurrence of respiratory failure required a prompt re-intubation.A percutaneous tracheotomy was performed with the placement of a cuffed non-fenestrated cannula (Tracoe 301–06, internal diameter 6.0 mm).The patient was ventilated in Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) mode.A chest CT showed parenchymal consolidation areas in the right upper lobe and bilateral pleural effusion, with no evidence of diaphragm elevation.A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) ruled out significant alterations in the tracheobronchial tree, after removal of dense mucous exudate.Blood tests showed anemia (Haemoglobin 8.2 g/dL), absence of leukocytosis and normal values of creatine kinase (CK) (43 U/L).\\\\nThe following week, a second electromyographic study confirmed normal data at limb examination.A diaphragm nerve conduction study revealed pathological low amplitude of both right and left responses as the only isolated neurophysiological alteration.The interpretation of the latter data was uncertain but a diagnostic work-up searching for primary neurological causes was scheduled.Blood CK, brain and cervical spine MRI, contrast-enhanced brachial plexus CT scan and cerebrospinal fluid examination were all found to be normal.\\\\nFollowing 10 days in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of our Pneumological ward.', 'A 58-year-old male presented with decreased vision in his left eye, without redness or floaters, which had persisted for three days.His medical history detailed a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome (membranous nephropathy), which had been treated with prednisone for a period of four months.Drug-induced diabetes was subsequently detected one month after the onset of corticosteroid treatment.The patient developed productive cough, pyrexia, and night sweats, and was further diagnosed with pneumonia three weeks before the admission.His medications at the time included prednisone 20 mg daily, insulin and oral cefdinir.He had no history of ocular trauma or surgery.\\\\nAn ophthalmic examination revealed visual acuities of 20/20 in the right eye and counting fingers at 2 ft in the left.Pupils were 3 mm and reactive in each eye without relative afferent pupillary defect.The right eye was normal.Slit lamp examination of the left eye was unremarkable.Fundus examination showed clear media and a creamy-white and raised subretinal lesion located at the posterior pole, with the lesion being five disc diameters in size.Additionally, multiple retinal hemorrhages were seen in the overlying retina (Fig.).The intraocular pressures were normal in both eyes.Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated a hyperreflective substance located in the subretinal space, between the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium (Fig.).Although a further diagnostic workup was requested on the follow day of presentation, the patient was lost to follow-up and presented five days later with reduced vision in the affected eye.On examination, slit lamp examination of the left eye showed mild conjunctival injection and anterior chamber cells of 2+.Fundus examination revealed mild vitritis and further, the area of the retinal lesion had expanded over the superior and inferior arcades (Fig.).\\\\nThe patient was admitted for further workup.All vital signs were stable and within normal range.The white cell count was 11.48 × 109/l, with 75.8% neutrophils, and the blood level of C-reactive protein was 59.9 mg/liter.Serum markers of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis and tuberculosis were all negative.A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple bilateral nodules, some of them cavitated in the lungs, which suggested of multiple abscesses (Fig.).In the context of his lung abscess, a presumptive diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis with subretinal abscess was made.\\\\nA vitreous tap along with empirical intravitreal injections of a combination of vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 ml) and ceftazidime (2 mg/0.1 ml) were performed on the day of hospitalization.The vitreous samples were sent for bacterial and fungal cultures, as well as bacterial, fungal and viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Blood and sputum cultures were also performed.Topical levofloxacin 0.5% and prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops were administrated four times daily, and in addition, oral prednisone and cefdinir were continued.Three days after initial intravitreal injections, the subretinal abscess had improved significantly (Fig.) and a second injection was administered.The subretinal abscess gradually improved, leaving only a small inferior lesion a week later (Fig.).Vitreous cultures and PCR were all negative, as were blood cultures.Nocardia, Heamophilus and Candida albicans were identified in sputum cultures.Based on the clinical data and the characteristic appearance of the ocular lesion, it was deduced that the causative organism was most likely Nocardia.As a result, a combination of oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was administrated.Ten days after hospitalization, the third intravitreal injections were repeated, with the patient then being discharged for follow-up as an outpatient with directions to continue with oral prednisone 20 mg daily and oral TMP-SMX for an further month.The patient remained in stable condition over the following four weeks after discharge.Further fundus examination revealed the subretinal abscess had resolved, leaving some yellowish subretinal precipitates and chorioretinal scarring, with visual acuity of 1/10 (Fig.).\\\\nSeven weeks after discharge, that is three weeks after cessation of TMP-SMX therapy, this patient was admitted to another hospital due to right extremity weakness and a lack of ability to walk or stand on his own for ten days.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multiple cystic-enhancing lesions with surrounding edema over both cerebral hemispheres, suggestive of multiple abscesses, whilst the retina remained quiescent (Fig.', 'Timeline\\\\nA previously healthy 16-year-old Chinese girl came to the Emergency Pediatric Department with progressive fever, cough, headache and tender right cervical lymphadenopathy of four days’ duration.She also complained of intense fatigue and dizziness and had had two episodes of syncope.She was initially treated at home with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate for four days, without improvement.On physical exam, she had a tender right retro-angulo-mandibular lymphadenopathy of 3 cm in diameter, without hepatosplenomegaly, and hyperemic pharynx.An initial US revealed the presence of multiple bilateral lymphadenopathies of different sizes (the largest 2.7 cm) with inflammatory characteristics (hypo-anechoic and hypervascularized nodes with perilesional hyperechoic tissues).CRP was 2.06 mg/dL (normal value < 0.5 mg/dL).A complete blood count revealed leukopenia with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 3690 cells/mm3.A broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy was started (cefotaxime 100 mg/kg/day), with partial regression of the lymphadenopathies and resolution of the fever.After six days, she recommenced having two daily fevers of up to 41 °C with progressive enlargement of the lymphadenopathies, which became extremely painful.New tender bilateral lymphadenopathies appeared in the inguinal and axillary areas.Blood tests revealed a worsening leukopenia with WBC 1930 cells/mm3, neutrophils 760 cells/mm3, ESR 33 mm/h (normal value < 20 mm/h), ferritin 1303 ng/dL, LDH 857 U/L.Due to persistent dry cough, oral clarithromycin was started (15 mg/kg/day).A thorax X ray and abdominal US were normal, while lymph node US was unchanged.EBV, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), CMV and multiple other viral, bacterial and fungal serum tests were all negative.Mantoux and Quantiferon Test were negative.Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome was ruled out, due to the absence of α/β double-negative T cells.\\\\nGiven her history suspicious for hematological disorders, bone marrow aspiration was performed, which revealed a slightly hypocellular marrow, with focal evidence of hemophagocytosis.Flow cytometry was negative for lymphoproliferative disorders and cytogenetic testing was normal.Perforin gene mutations were absent.Due to the persistence of high fever and painful lymphadenopathies, cefotaxime was replaced by piperacillin/tazobactam (150 mg/kg/day) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day).After 24 h, there was regression of the fever by lysis and regression of the systemic lymphadenopathies, associated with an improvement in inflammatory markers, except for persistent neutropenia.\\\\nOne week later, the fever returned and the patient reported intense fatigue, malaise and progressive enlargement of the previous lymphadenopathies, which were extremely painful and swollen.An excisional cervical lymph node biopsy was then performed, which was diagnostic for KFD (Fig.): as in case 1, the biopsy revealed wedge-shaped subcapsular necrotic foci composed of fibrinoid material with karyorrhectic debris, histiocytes with plasmacytoid features and crescentic nuclei, and several mitotically active immunoblasts; no granulocytic component was found.While in case 1 the finding was focal in the lymph node (that showed an overall preserved architecture with hyperplastic germinal centers) but extensive in the tissue fragments, in this case the lymph node was effaced by numerous necrotic foci.Immunohistochemistry revealed in both cases a T-cell phenotype (CD3+, CD2+, CD5+, CD7+, CD43+, CD8+ > CD4+) for the immunoblasts, along with focal and weak positivity for CD30, and a high proliferation index (Ki-67 / MIB-1 = 60%); ALK-1, EMA, CD25, CD56 and TdT were all negative.The B-cell markers CD20 and PAX5 highlighted only a few, scattered B-cells.Plasmacytoid histiocytes stained positively for CD68PG-M1 and CD123.In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus was negative.\\\\nThis histological picture suggested a T-cell neoplasm as the main differential diagnosis [, ]: however, the absence of T-cell antigen loss and of polyclonal T-cell receptor gamma chain rearrangement [] were not indicative of a T-cell malignancy.Additionally, the clinical history, and the somewhat peculiar histological features (presence of a histiocytic component with typical plasmacytoid morphology in the background of fibrinoid necrosis, and absence of a granulocytic component), were indicative of KFD (relapsed in case 1) in the “proliferative” phase [–].\\\\nAfter 4 days, the fever spontaneously disappeared.However, inflammatory markers were still elevated, with alteration of liver enzymes and coagulation pattern (ALT 875 U/L, AST 342 U/L, LDH 1682 U/L, CRP 3.65 mg/dL, ferritin 9329 ng/mL, APTT 1.30, D-Dimer 2888 ng/mL, WBC 1500 cells/mm3, neutrophils 760 cells/mm3), suggestive of initial HLH.The patient was started on pulsed methylprednisolone therapy (1 g/day for 3 days) followed by prednisone (1.5 mg/kg/day) in combination with cyclosporine (4 mg/kg/day).A rapid improvement in her lymphadenopathies, fever and constitutional symptoms was seen soon after immunosuppressive therapy was started.A progressive normalization of blood analysis was also observed, with improvement of the leukopenia.\\\\nAlthough her symptoms improved with high doses of prednisone, the clinical course was complicated by the development of glucocorticoid-induced diabetes and hypertension.After four days of steroid treatment, the patient had a sudden rise in blood pressure (162/108 mmHg) associated with headache and malaise.Some hours later, she presented two generalized tonic-clonic seizures with cyanosis, requiring the administration of oxygen and intravenous diazepam.We performed an urgent computerized tomography (CT) brain scan, which was normal.Given the combination of generalized seizures, high blood pressure and immunosuppressive therapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was then performed, which showed pathological alterations suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).', 'A 66-year-old female was found to have an abnormality in the lower outer quadrant of her left breast on screening mammogram.Core biopsy showed infiltrating ductal cancer.Her medical history was significant for smoking, Type 2 diabetes and transient ischaemic attacks.\\\\nShe underwent left partial mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy.Pathological examination revealed moderately differentiated infiltrating ductal cancer, pT1c (16 mm), N1mi(sn) (0.5 mm); oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative; and Oncotype DX score 21.Post-surgical staging CT scan (node-positive disease) revealed bilateral lung masses: left upper lobe measuring 1.2 cm and right lower lobe measuring 1.8 cm, and both were proven to be positron emission tomography (PET) fludeoxyglucose avid ().An MRI of the brain and a bone scan showed no evidence of metastases.\\\\nDifferential diagnosis included three synchronous primary cancers or metastatic disease.', \"An 80-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department of our institution with a 5-day history of headaches.A week ago, she had presented with a minor head trauma that was caused by a fall.She had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia and had experienced focal cerebral infarction 10 years earlier.The patient had no neurologic abnormalities, except for headache.An initial non-contrast brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed a scanty subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on the left ambient cistern with an enlarged ventricle (Fig.A).Subsequent brain CT angiography (CTA) showed no vascular abnormalities.Based on the CT findings and the patient's history of trauma, she was admitted to the neurosurgery department as a suspected case of traumatic SAH, following which her symptoms improved gradually.On the 10th day of hospitalization, the patient showed sudden stuporous mental deterioration.Brain CT performed at that time revealed SAH on all the cisterns, with intraventricular hemorrhage (Fig.B).A CTA performed immediately after the procedure revealed no definitive cerebral aneurysm on 3-dimensional reconstruction images, but a suspicious aneurysmal lesion was seen in the distal PICA in the thin axial CTA image (Fig.C).Subsequent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a bilobulated distal PICA aneurysm, and an endovascular treatment was planned (Fig.A).Coil embolization was performed under general anesthesia.After a right femoral artery puncture, the left vertebral artery (VA) was not visible on left subclavian angiography; therefore, a 6-Fr soft, torqueable catheter optimized for intracranial access (SOFIA; MicroVention Terumo, Tustin, CA) was advanced into the V4 segment of the right VA under roadmap guidance.Subsequently, we attempted to reach the Headway 17 microcatheter (MicroVention Terumo, Tustin, CA) into the aneurysmal sac, but it failed due to the acute angle of the vertebra–PICA junction.Therefore, after deploying the coil in the VA just before the PICA origin, we planned to position the microcatheter in the PICA with the support of the coil mass (Fig.B).However, some of the coil masses deployed to the VA migrated upward of the PICA origin unintentionally during the navigation process using a microwire and microcatheter (Fig.C).Therefore, we additionally deployed a coil to the VA and finished the procedure after confirming PICA occlusion (Fig.D).Fortunately, with supportive care in an intensive care unit after the procedure, the patient recovered fully, and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed no definitive acute cerebral infarction in the PICA territory.One year after embolization, a follow-up angiography was performed, which revealed recanalization of the right PICA with normal arterial configuration, and no aneurysmal sacs were observed in the distal PICA.The recanalized VA was located medial to the deployed coil mass (Fig.E).\", 'This was a 43-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma who had undergone liver transplantation from a living donor.A year later, he developed severe acute pancreatitis with severe abdominal pain.On admission to the hospital, continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day was started to control abdominal pain.The fentanyl dose was increased according to pain intensity, reaching 2400 μg/day (MED 240 mg/day) after 10 days in the hospital.Administration of a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid alleviated the pancreatitis and abdominal pain.shows that continuous fentanyl infusion was discontinued after reaching 240 μg/day (10% of the maximum dose).He subsequently developed nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation.Continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion of 240 μg/day was resumed, and these symptoms disappeared.However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced.Therefore, a transdermal fentanyl patch was initiated to taper the opioid more slowly.Pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later.Therefore, continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion was resumed, titrated to 600 μg/day.The dose was gradually decreased daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 μg/day).Once the pancreatitis had improved, the fentanyl could be discontinued without causing withdrawal symptoms.The discontinuation was finally completed 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms.', 'A girl aged 16 years presented with fever, abdominal pain in the epigastric and ileocecal region, nausea, lack of appetite, and vomiting of two days’ duration.Patient 5 had a recurrence of acute uncomplicated appendicitis.She had had the first episode two years previously, with acute uncomplicated appendicitis.She was treated conservatively with antibiotics; however, she was ultimately operated on laparoscopically.In her case, COVID-19 infection presumably exacerbated the course of appendicitis and resulted in abdominal pain that was a cause for diagnostic laparoscopy and further appendectomy.Unlike the four other cases in which the histology showed necrotic areas in the appendix wall, concluding that appendectomy was necessary (gangrenous appendicitis—see ), Patient 5’s surgery could have been avoided if symptoms had not persisted.', \"A 50-year-old male with no past medical history presented to the hospital with one week of painless blurry vision of the right eye.He had also been having intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on the bilateral lower extremities for 6 months.On further review of systems, the patient noted one isolated episode of left knee swelling as well as testicular swelling in the past.The patient otherwise denied any neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynaud's phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity.He worked as a flooring installer, and he did not have any toxic habits such as smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use.\\\\nThe patient's vital signs were normal.On physical exam, the patient was found to have bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema, right greater than left, right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect, and a right afferent pupillary defect.Muscle strength was 5/5 throughout, and reflexes were 2+ throughout.Sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception was intact.The bilateral lower extremities demonstrated a maculopapular rash ().\\\\nThe admitting labs were notable for a microcytic anemia (Hb 11.6 gm/dL (ref 13.6–17.3); Hct 35.3% (ref 39.8–50.7); MCV 76.9 fL (ref 80.3–98.1)), hyponatremia (133 mmol/L (ref 136–144)), elevated ESR (33 mm/hr (ref 0–15)), and elevated CRP (13.3 mg/L (ref 0.0–7.0)).Urinalysis did not show protein or blood.Lumbar puncture was colorless/clear with 2/cumm RBC (ref 0), 56/cumm WBC (ref 0–9), 39% segmented neutrophils (ref 0–2), 53% lymphocytes (ref 40–80%), 30 glucose (ref 40–70), 69 protein (ref 15–45), with presence of oligoclonal bands, an elevated IgG index (+19.8 mg/24 hr (ref −9.9 to +3.3)), and normal opening pressure (16 cm H20 (ref 10–25 cm H20)).The initial CT scan of brain and orbits demonstrated no acute intracranial process, and the MRI of the orbits was also unremarkable.\\\\nGiven the patient's history of fever, myalgia, rash, and joint pain with CSF studies showing both a neutrophilic and lymphocytic pleocytosis, there was concern for infectious etiologies, including both bacterial and viral infections, as well as autoimmune etiologies.\", 'A 19-year-old male presented to the emergency department at 10:42 a.m.,42 min after the sudden onset of slurred speech with weakness of his right upper and lower extremities.He reported no headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fever, or convulsions.He denied any significant medical history, drug abuse, or high-risk sexual behaviors.He had no history of migraines, trauma, insect bites, exposure to chemicals, or use of medications.Apart from cigarette smoking for 1 year, he denied other risk factors for stroke.There was no history of early cardiovascular disease in the family.\\\\nOn physical examination, the patient’s vital signs were normal.His weight was 65 kg (69 kg, 3 weeks ago), body mass index (BMI) 21.47 kg/m2.His chest examination was clear, and no additional murmurs were detected upon cardiac examinations.The liver, spleen and cervical lymph nodes were not enlarged; no skin or mucosal lesions were seen.He was alert and oriented to person, place, and time.The pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation.He had mild right hemiplegia with strength of 4:5 in the right upper and lower extremities; slight dysarthria and right lower facial paresis were also noted.The neurologic examination was otherwise unremarkable.The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 3.\\\\nRapid blood glucose was in the normal range (6.3 mmol/L).Complete blood count results showed white blood cell (WBC) count 3.0 × 109/L, hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, and platelets 273 × 1012/L.Stroke was first considered.As he was then in the 4.5-h time window for IV-rtPA, an urgent brain CT with computed tomography angiography (CTA) of intra–extracranial vessels and whole-brain computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging were performed in the emergency department.The nonenhanced CT (NECT) scan (Fig.) and CTA (Fig.) were normal.CTP showed hypoperfusion in the left hemisphere with prolonged mean transit time (MTT) and time-to-peak (TTP), slightly increased cerebral blood volume (CBV), and relatively preserved cerebral blood flow (CBF) (Fig.-).A diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke was made.After excluding absolute contraindications for intravenous thrombolysis, 58.5 mg (0.9 mg/kg) rtPA was given at 12:30 a.m., immediately after the patient signed the informed consent.After 1 h of rtPA, his symptoms were alleviated, and the NIHSS score was decreased to 1, with slight asymmetry of the nasolabial sulcus.The patient was then admitted to the department of neurology for further investigations and treatment.Within 60 min after admission, the clinical neurological examination had completely normalized.\\\\nOn the next day, the patient had no complaints of discomfort.The NIHSS score was 0.Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and no acute lesion was seen in the diffusion-weighted image (DWI) sequences (Fig.', 'A 40-year-old female, with 3-month history of nasal obstruction and tinnitus was admitted in August 2012.Nasopharyngeal endoscopy and biopsy already had been performed in another hospital, showing nonkeratinizing undifferentiated NPC.This histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed in our center.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the nasopharynx and neck revealed the tumor was confined to the nasopharynx and the bilateral locoregional cervical lymph nodes enlarged with its greatest dimension of 2 cm.', 'The proband is a 10-year-old Sri Lankan girl of Sinhala ethnicity born to healthy non-consanguineous parents with two other older, healthy sons.She had an uneventful pregnancy and birth history and there was no family history of ophthalmological or neurological diseases.Although her parents noted delayed development, they had not sought medical attention for this.She started walking unaided at around 9 years and continues to have a significantly unsteady gait.Her hearing was not affected but speech was delayed (first word at 3 years and currently speaking 3–4-word complex sentences).Her parents reported photophobia since infancy.\\\\nOn examination aged 10 years, her height, weight and occipito-frontal circumference were 132 cm (10th–25th centile), 26 kg (25th–50th centile) and 51 cm (25th–50th centile) respectively.She had no dysmorphic features.A pigmented macule with a serpiginous border (22 cm × 10 cm), which may represent a blaschcoid pattern suggestive of a cutaneous mosaicism, was noted on her right thigh (Fig.).Neurological examination revealed an ataxic gait, hypotonia, dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, horizontal nystagmus and dysarthria, all consistent with cerebellar disease.No pyramidal or extrapyramidal signs were identified.She had bilateral pes planus (Fig.).Ophthalmological examination revealed her pupils to be fixed and dilated and slit lamp examination revealed bilateral partial aniridia (Fig.) with a scalloped edge of the irises, normal fundi and impaired pupillary light reflexes.Pupillary membrane remnants were not seen and the cornea and lens were clear.Visual acuity was reduced (bilateral 6/30).Intelligence Quotient (IQ) assessment revealed moderate learning disability with better verbal IQ (verbal comprehension, working memory and processing speed scales) than non-verbal IQ (Test of Nonverbal Intelligence – TONI version 3- score 70).Her short-term memory was within normal limits although she had deficits in long-term memory.\\\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed cerebellar hypoplasia especially affecting the vermis and white matter changes (Fig.', 'A 62-year-old male patient presented with progressive worsening of mental function, dysphasia, and ataxic gait in the last six months.Five years prior to presentation (in August 2012), he was diagnosed with communicating hydrocephalus possibly caused by tuberculous meningoencephalitis because of mental confusion and gait disturbance.He underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery in one hospital.His mental confusion and gait disturbance immediately improved following the ventriculoperitoneal shunt.Results of CSF study were negative for tuberculosis.However, a provisional diagnosis of communicating hydrocephalus caused by tuberculous meningitis was made based on MRI findings of leptomeningeal enhancement in the basal cisterns (Figures and ).', 'A previously healthy 49-year-old female with a past medical history of well-controlled hypertension and body mass index (BMI) of 30.37 kg/m2 presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, abdominal pain, hematemesis, and hypotension.According to family, the patient complained of abdominal pain earlier that morning and was later found at home minimally responsive and recurrently vomiting blood.\\\\nIn the emergency department, the patient’s vitals included a blood pressure of 94/50 mmHg, a temperature of 87.1 Fahrenheit, and a respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute.The patient was intubated for airway protection.She received 5L of fluid as well as one unit of packed red blood cells for suspected large fluid volume loss.Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and was remarkable for a Mallory-Weiss tear with portohypertensive gastropathy.This was thought to be caused by the repeated vomiting reported by her family.CT scan showed peripancreatic edema and fat stranding, consistent with acute pancreatitis (Figure ).A repeat CT scan was done to evaluate the progression of her pancreatitis, which showed worsening pancreatitis with developing ascites.Labs were remarkable for a glucose up to 955 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) of 13.7%, and a triglyceride level up to 1608 mg/dL (Table ).The patient was then placed on an insulin drip for her significantly elevated blood glucose.After her glucose normalized, she was continued on an insulin drip until her triglycerides dropped below 500 mg/dL.The patient was then downgraded to the general medical floor and discharged after being able to tolerate a regular diet without significant pain or discomfort.', \"A 48-year-old man with no apparent past medical history initially presented with abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting.Physical examination was unremarkable.Lab results were significant for anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL (14–18), hematocrit 32.2% (42–52), and lipase 164 U/L (13–60).His comprehensive metabolic panel was unrevealing.A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed, which revealed an enlarged pancreas without a focal mass, diffuse surrounding mesenteric edema, mild retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, mild mesenteric lymphadenopathy, rectal wall thickening with perirectal lymphadenopathy, left renal mass measuring 3.7 × 1.4 × 1.4 cm, right renal mass measuring 2.3 × 4.3 × 5.2 cm, marked diffuse urinary bladder wall thickening, and trace pericardial effusion ().The concern at the time was for peritoneal carcinomatosis and/or mesenteric tumor.Urology and oncology services were invited to evaluate the patient, both in agreement for a biopsy of the lymph node; in addition, urine cytology and HIV were tested.\\\\nUrine cytology revealed atypical lymphocytes.Renal biopsy revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with involvement of B-cell lymphoma.HTLV-I/II antibody was negative.HIV screening returned with a positive result.Initial CD4 was 440/μl with a percentage of 14%, and HIV RNA viral load by PCR was 61800 copies/mL.Hepatitis C virus screening was negative; hepatitis B screening was positive for the core antibody and surface antibody but negative for surface antigen.His lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was above the upper limit of the detection for our lab, >2500 U/L (135–225).Cerebrospinal fluid at the time revealed atypical lymphocytes.\\\\nBiopsy of the kidney mass revealed atypical lymphocytes positive for CD45, CD20, PAX-5, and CD10, while negative for CD5, CD30, MUM-1, BCL-1 (cyclin D1), BCL-2, BCL-6, c-myc, CD68, CD34, CD117, and MPO, with a high proliferation index (Ki-67) of 80% approximately.The morphology was consistent with diffuse B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), NOS, and germinal center B-cell subtype involving the kidney.A subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed involvement by DLBCL ().\\\\nHis Revised International Prognostic Indicator (R-IPI) was calculated to be 4, NCCN-IPI of 5, and CNS-IPI of 4.Decision was made to offer him dose-adjusted rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH) to treat his disease.For HIV, he was treated with raltegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine, with a subsequent decrease in viral load to our laboratory's threshold for undetectable.This regimen was chosen specifically for the tenofovir to act as prophylaxis to suppress hepatitis B virus reactivation.In addition, he was treated with fluconazole and acyclovir for antimicrobial prophylaxis.He received 3 cycles of chemotherapy and 1 dose of intrathecal methotrexate, with initial improvement in renal lesions.However, after the third cycle, he presented with dysphagia, Bell's palsy, and diffuse bone pain.Neurology service was consulted recommending MRI of the brain without contrast, which was unremarkable.\", 'A 3-year-old boy born to non-consanguineous parents of Chinese/Malaysian ethnicity presented at 2 months of age with acute respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation and an interstitial pneumonitis on X-ray (Figure A).Bronchoalveolar lavage identified Pneumocystis jirovecii by both PCR and immunofluorescence.He was treated with co-trimoxazole and made a full recovery (Figure B).Immunological work up performed at the time revealed normal immunoglobulin levels, with CD4+ and CD8+ lymphopenia (Table ).The CD8+ count normalized rapidly but his CD4+ lymphopenia persisted until he was 5 months of age.CD19+ B cell and NK cell numbers were normal; however, the B cell numbers climbed and have remained high (range 2.5–6.0 × 109/L—reference range 0.2–2.1 × 109/L).T cell immunophenotyping identified no abnormality (Table ).Mitogen-specific T-cell blastogenesis with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was preserved; however, T-cell stimulation with anti-CD3 in early life was absent, and stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 at 9 months of age was reduced threefold compared with a control sample (Table ).He displayed features of global developmental delay at 7 months and was noted to be hypertonic floppy with normal deep tendon reflexes and a normal MRI of the brain.', 'Our patient was a 47 year old female with a history of ulcerative colitis, Sjogren’s syndrome, migraines, and fibromyalgia who presented with a 6 month history of left lower extremity paresthesia followed by a 2 month history of progressive headaches, imbalance, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and diplopia.Neurologic examination revealed severe gait ataxia requiring assistance to stand or walk and nystagmus with lateral gaze.MRI revealed a 3.0 cm heterogeneously enhancing mixed cystic and solid mass centered upon the cerebellar vermis with mild surrounding vasogenic edema and abnormal thickened enhancement of the bilateral vestibular nerves, left facial nerve, and right trigeminal nerve (Fig.', 'A 50-year-old Chinese man with no prior illnesses presented with a history of one month of fever, headache, and vomiting.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multiple varying sizes of ring-enhancing lesions scattered in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres.', \"A 28-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was associated with nausea.Two weeks prior to admission, she had symptoms of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea which was later diagnosed to be amebiasis.The patient was diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis at the age of 6 months when she developed arrhythmia related to a cardiac rhabdomyoma.The rest of the medical history included adenoma sebaceum, Ash leaf spots, bilateral renal angiomyolipomas, left-sided retinal hamartoma, and allergic rhinitis.She was previously operated 3 times for the removal of multiple renal angiomyolipomas and underwent partial cystectomy due to invasion of the tumor.Physical examination was normal.The laboratory work-up was unremarkable except for anemia (hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL) and an elevated C-reactive protein value of 125 mg/dL.The computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed extralumination of the rectal contrast material at the rectosigmoid region, indicating bowel perforation.The patient underwent proctosigmoidectomy and formation of an end colostomy together with the closure of the anorectal stump (Hartmann operation).Two weeks after the operation, the patient developed a new onset abdominal pain.The CT scan revealed contrast extralumination in the distal ileum and the patient underwent ileocecal resection due to a new onset bowel perforation and severe adhesions.Several days after the second operation she developed fever and was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection for which she took treatment.Both of the rectosigmoid resection specimen and the ileocecal resection specimen were reported as leiomyomatosis-like lymphangioleiomyomatosis (Fig.).After 8 months of follow-up, the patient's rectoscopic examination together with a control CT scan was normal.At the first year of follow-up, the patient had an ileostomy closure surgery.\\\\nGrossly, the rectosigmoid specimen (16 cm in length, 7 cm in width, 1 cm in thickness) consisted of full-thickness hemorrhage extending 7 cm proximally from the surgical margin.Macroscopically, there was a 3 cm perforation area in the central part of this hemorrhagic region.Pseudopolypoid lesions ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 cm in diameter were observed in the surrounding mucosa.The ileocecal resection material (ileum 4 cm and colon 16 cm in length) consisted of a 5 cm, pale-colored, nodular lesion in the cecum.Numerous pale nodular lesions, ranging from 0.3 to 5 cm in diameter extending from the mucosa to the subserosa were observed in the cecum.In all resected specimens, the intestinal wall was diffusely thickened and nodular.Infiltration into the subserosal adipose tissue was observed.\\\\nHistological examination revealed nodular lesions with an extensive growth pattern, extending from the submucosa to the mesorectal adipose tissue in some areas, without affecting the mucosa.Microscopically, the nodules consisted of spindle cell bundles with prominent elongated nuclei organized into branching short fascicles (Fig.).Necrosis, pleomorphism, and mitotic activity were not observed.Among the spindle cells, clusters of epithelioid cells were observed around dilated vascular structures lined with endothelium in some areas (Fig.).It was noted that these epithelioid cell assemblages in the vessel walls tended to merge with the surrounding lymphatics.Mature adipose tissue was not observed.In the surrounding intestine where the tumor was absent, severe active colitis findings were observed.Immunohistochemically, the spindle and epithelioid cells in both of the resected specimens stained positive for desmin, SMA, and HMB45 and negative for CD34, DOG-1, c-KIT, S100, ER, and PR (Fig.).The Ki-67 proliferation index was found to be 3%.There was no evidence of lymphatic or vascular invasion.\", 'Male, 69 y/o, with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and previous myocardial infarction.He was affected by severe degenerative aortic stenosis and underwent trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with LOTUS Edge 27 mm in April 2020.TTE performed a few days after the TAV implantation detected an increased transprosthesis gradient (maximum/median gradient, 78/52 mm Hg) in the absence of fever or positive hemoculture.TEE showed hypomobility of the noncoronary cusp of the bioprosthesis ().Valve’s thrombosis was suspected and heparin administration was started.MDCT detected a paravalvular leak caused by misfolding of the prosthesis’ frame; the suspicion of valve thrombosis was also confirmed by the finding of two hypodense appositions at the lower edge of the valve.The patient underwent balloon valvuloplasty with complete resolution of the valvular dysfunction (a–c).', \"A 28-year-old man without any underlying diseases had suffered from left side weakness and clonic–tonic seizures for 12 days.Computed tomography (CT) of the patient's head revealed a hypodensed mass with the size of 3 × 3 × 2.4 cm of the right temporal lobe.He was then admitted, and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain showed cystic astrocytoma in the right parietal lobe without midline shifting.\", \"A 42-year-old gentleman with no prior medical illness admitted with complaints of generalized muscle pain, dry skin, and mild facial puffiness of eight days duration, associated with choking sensation in his throat.The review of systems was negative for fever, hoarse voice, cold intolerance, hair loss, dysphagia, constipation, weight gain, focal limb weakness, or changes in memory.He denied doing strenuous exercise recently, alcohol consumption, trauma, or recent medication use.There was no family history of autoimmune thyroid diseases.\\\\nHis vital signs were as following: pulse rate, 65/min (regular); blood pressure, 120/85 mmHg; respiratory rate, 19/min; and oral temperature, 37.1°C.Physical examination revealed mild facial puffiness, dry skin, and minimal non-pitting lower limb edema.A small goiter without tenderness or nodule was found on neck examination.The musculoskeletal examination did not show muscle wasting, hypertrophy, or weakness.Other system examinations were unremarkable.\\\\nLaboratory investigations were suggestive of severe hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), >100 mIU/ml (normal range <4.35 mIU/L); free T4, <0.5 ng/dl (normal range 11 – 23.3 pmol/L); anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody titer, >600 IU/ml (normal range <34 IU/ml); and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) titer, 1831 IU/ml (normal range <115).Elevated levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody and anti-thyroglobulin antibody titers were suggestive of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.Serum creatine kinase (21,644 U/L, normal range 39–308 U/L) and myoglobin (2,208 ng/ml, normal range 28–72 ng/ml) levels were also raised (Table ).This was associated with acute kidney injury with mild elevation of serum creatinine (1.44 mg/dl).Urine examination was negative for myoglobinuria or hematuria.The daily urine output was normal (250–300 ml/h).\\\\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were normal.Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed minimal circumferential pericardial effusion without regional wall-motion abnormalities and with a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 58%.Fiber-optic (flexible) laryngoscopy was normal.\\\\nA probable diagnosis of hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis with rhabdomyolysis was made based on the clinical and laboratory parameters.He was treated with intravenous fluids and was started on oral levothyroxine.His symptoms improved with the treatment, and the levels of CK and myoglobin showed a decreasing trend.He was discharged on Day 4, and on further follow-up, the muscle enzymes showed a further decreasing trend (Figures and ) and normalization of renal parameters.Since there was complete resolution of symptoms with the patient returning to his regular day-to-day activities, further workup to exclude muscle diseases was not carried out.\", 'A 65-year-old man with no relevant family or personal history was admitted due to a 2-day history of mild dysarthria and naming impairment with difficulty finding words and holding a conversation.Furthermore, his family reported at least one-month history of motor awkwardness and gait instability.During the neurological examination, the patient was well oriented, displayed fluent, coherent spontaneous language, and had mild dysnomia.He had remarkable clinical symptoms of parkinsonism: glabellar reflex was persistent; the patient presented a decreased blinking rate, hypomimia, moderate bradykinesia and hypokinesia in the right limbs, and slow gait with reduced right arm swing (Hoehn & Yahr stage I).The examination revealed no further abnormalities.With the clinical suspicion of parkinsonism, we performed a complete blood test performed at baseline, with either normal or negative.A brain MRI scan revealed increased signal intensity in the left putamen with diffusion restriction, suggesting lacunar infarction ().', 'A 58-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented with shortness of breath, fever, and cough for three days.The patient received two doses of the COVID vaccine, with the second dose in May 2021.In the ER, her vital signs were BP 105/96, HR 131 bpm, RR 20 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 96% on room air, and febrile with a temperature of 102.0°F.Laboratory assessment is in Table .Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive.CT chest on admission shows no acute infiltrate and nonspecific nodules (Figure ).The patient was admitted to the general medical ward and started on antibiotics, dexamethasone, and remdesivir.The patient developed worsening hypoxia on Day 2, and CT chest showed widespread airspace disease throughout the lungs (Figure ).The patient required 4-5 L per minute via nasal cannula.', 'In September 2020, a 42-year-old male was referred to our Department of Internal Medicine because of a finding in a chest X-ray.The patient was healthy with no previous hospitalizations and worked as a nurse at our institution.He was not taking any medications, had no smoking history, and was presenting no malignancy-related symptoms (fatigue, unintended weight loss, or changes in bowel habits).He had seen an anesthesiologist before being seen by a surgeon due to an inguinal hernia, a minor condition.The anesthesiologist noticed the pulmonary lesion.A chest X-ray showed a solitary pulmonary nodule in the right mid-lung that was 2 cm in diameter (Figure ).The patient was asymptomatic, as mentioned above, and had a previous chest X-ray that was normal.\\\\nIn a physical examination, his temperature was 36.7°C, blood pressure was 138/78 mm Hg, heart rate was 76 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 98% in room air.In auscultation, heart and lung sounds were normal.Both oropharyngeal and abdominal examinations were normal, and he had no periodontal disease.The patient was admitted to the hospital for further investigation.\\\\nBlood tests were normal, with a white blood cell count of 9,430 leucocytes/mm3 with 63% neutrophils, hemoglobin level of 153 g/L, and platelet count of 205 × 109/L.C-reactive protein was 83 mg/dL (normal range: <5 mg/dL).A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was negative on hospitalization day 1 (Table ).As mentioned, a chest X-ray showed a solitary pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe.\\\\nOur patient presented with a solitary pulmonary nodule, which raised the suspicion of a primary lung tumor or metastasis of unknown origin.For further radiological characterization and assessment of the pulmonary node, the patient underwent a thoracic CT scan, which revealed ground glass opacities that suggested either inflammatory or infectious conditions (Figure ), similar to atypical pneumonia.A second RT-PCR was performed on hospitalization day 3, and the result was positive.Based on these data, we established a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in an asymptomatic patient.The first test for the qualitative detection of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 (a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay) was negative on hospitalization day 3.\\\\nOn day 5, the examination was normal, the patient’s oxygen saturation was 98%-99% in room air, and laboratory blood tests were normal, so we discharged the patient with no treatment, but he was attended in a follow-up in our outpatient clinic with a new chest X-ray and new laboratory blood tests on day 10 after discharge.The chest X-ray showed complete resolution of pneumonia, and laboratory blood tests were normal, with C-reactive protein < 5 mg/dL and a positive test for IgG against SARS-CoV-2.', 'A 43-year-old Caucasian male reported a 1-month history of spontaneous clear left side nipple discharge with a recent appearance of a homolateral painless breast swelling.There was no history of bloody discharge.Past medical history was pertinent for obesity class I (BMI: 33.3) and bilateral hypoacusia for otosclerosis.There was no family history for breast or ovarian cancer.His social history indicated no use of alcohol, but previous use (twelve years ago) of tobacco products.\\\\nOn physical examination, he was an overweight Caucasian male with symmetrical breasts.On palpation, there was a bilateral pseudogynaecomastia with a smooth, ill-defined left breast thickening, especially at the union of the outer quadrants.With applied pressure, a minimal clear stream of discharge fluid was elicited from the left nipple and was felt to be localized to a single duct.\\\\nDigital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) with synthesized reconstructed 2D images (s2D) was performed in medio-lateral-oblique (MLO) projections for each breast and in both cranio-caudal (CC) and latero-medial (LM) projections for the left breast.The s2D images showed a regular appearance of the breast buttons without gynaecomastia, and an area of asymmetrical density at the union of outer quadrants of the left breast that was better identified at the DBT images as an area of architectural distortion with scattered peripheral punctate calcifications, sparing the nipple-areolar complex.().\\\\nA breast ultrasound (US), performed on the same day, showed in correspondence of the mammographic findings, the presence of an ill-defined, hypoechoic area of acoustic shadowing with peripheral anechoic lacunae and a close small focal ductal ectasia.()\\\\nAccording to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) [], these findings were classified as category 4b.\\\\nAn US-guided Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology (US-FNAC) was performed.Our laboratory received 4 microscope slides fixed in alcohol and coloured with Papanicolaou stain.Microscopic examination showed atypical ductal cells with poor myoepithelium arguing for several types of proliferative non-malignant lesions but also DCIS.According to the IAC Yokohama System for Reporting Breast Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy Cytopathology (1st Edition, 2020) [], these findings were classified as category C4 ().Since the Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) [] already showed this suspicious atypia, we contextually performed an US-guided biopsy (US-CNB) with a 16 Gauge (G) semi-automated core biopsy needle.Our laboratory received two specimens of breast tissue of 1.5 cm of maximum dimension who were submitted for routine processing.Microscopic examination showed breast parenchyma with fibrosis with a focal area of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), p63 positive and with focal positivity for CK5/6.According to Guidelines for non-operative diagnostic procedures and reporting in breast cancer screening [], these findings were classified as category B3 ().\\\\nAll the findings of cytology and histology in association with the radiological assessment underlined the importance of the triple test [] and recommended us to perform surgical excision of the suspected area.Therefore, after discussing with the multidisciplinary team (MDT), according to the patient’s consent, a left subcutaneous nipple-sparing mastectomy was performed without sentinel lymph node biopsy ().\\\\nOur laboratory received a specimen designated left mastectomy, weighing 90 g ().It comprised oriented fibro-fatty tissue, 8 × 4.5 × 4 cm in aggregate, which on gross examination revealed an area of small cystic formations and a whitish lesion of 0.2 cm on which random samplings were performed.Microscopic examination showed an intraductal papilloma (IP) with ADH and a single focus of DCIS solid-cribriform type, respectively.Nuclear grade was 3 (p63+, CK5/6−) with negative surgical margins.No invasive cancer was present ().The specimen was sent for immunohistochemical examination of estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor.The tissue was positive for both ER (with 70% of nuclei staining with strong intensity) and PR (80% of nuclei staining strongly) ().Venipuncture samples were subsequently sent to an external laboratory for genetic analysis, the results of which were negative for BRCA1 and 2, and other mutations ().\\\\nAccording to these surprising results, after a clinically and radiologically evaluation of the left axillary lymph nodes, the MDT decided not to perform axillary dissection and to administer tamoxifen as approved adjuvant hormone treatment of men with ER-positive early stage breast cancer [].\\\\nThe patient was noted to be doing well 6 months post-operatively and is still on follow-up at the time of writing.', 'A six-year-old, 9.7 kg, male Cavalier King Charles spaniel was referred to the Cardiology Unit of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Bologna with a two-month history of severe exercise intolerance associated with a syncopal episode.Clinical signs had developed during a local wave of COVID-19 approximately two weeks after the family of its owner had manifested symptoms of this viral disease and their positivity to SARS-CoV-2 had been confirmed by the local Health authority.Despite the dog’s clinical condition, evaluation at our institution was postponed and performed only after two months from the occurrence of the aforementioned signs due to the COVID-19 illness and related quarantine of the owners.The dog had been previously evaluated by the primary veterinarian several times since he was a puppy, as regular examinations were performed approximately every six months.Previous medical history was unremarkable and no cardiac problems had been identified at earlier examinations.The patient was an indoor dog that was being fed a high-quality balanced commercial diet.He had no known exposure to toxic agents or medications and was current on vaccinations and parasite prevention.\\\\nUpon presentation, cardiac auscultation revealed a grade II/VI left apical systolic murmur; the heart rate was 136 beats/min and the cardiac rhythm was regular.The femoral pulse was strong and synchronous with the heartbeat.Non-invasive systolic arterial blood pressure, assessed by a high-definition oscillometric device (petMAP graphic, Ramsey Medical, Inc., Tampa, USA), was 166 mmHg. Given the patient’s anxiety during physical examination, the pressure value was primarily interpreted as situational hypertension.Respiratory rate was mildly accelerated (44 breaths/min), likely due to the dog’s emotional stress, but lung auscultation was within normal limits.The remainder of the physical examination were unremarkable.Thoracic radiographs revealed mild generalised enlargement of the cardiac silhouette (vertebral heart scale 11.5, breed-specific reference interval 10.60 ± 0.50 []), with no obvious lung parenchymal abnormalities ().Sinus rhythm was observed on a six-lead surface electrocardiogram (Cube ECG, Cardioline S.p.A., Caverano, Italy) ().A transthoracic echocardiography was also performed by a board-certified cardiologist (GR) using an ultrasound unit (iE33 ultrasound system, Philips Healthcare, Monza, Italy) equipped with phased-array transducers (3–8 and 1–5 MHz) and continuous electrocardiographic tracing (, ).This showed LV volume overload and global systolic dysfunction without concomitant left atrial dilation ().Although the mitral valve leaflets were structurally and functionally normal, a mild mitral regurgitation with central jet was present.In light of the aforesaid findings, the valve insufficiency was hypothesized to be functional and due to the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) phenotype.No other echocardiographic abnormalities were identified.\\\\nResults of routine blood work, including complete blood count, serum chemistry and coagulation profile (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen and antithrombin), were unremarkable.In light of the DCM phenotype, further laboratory tests included a thyroid profile and assessment of the serum concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI, IMMULITE 20000, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).The former test ruled out hypothyroidism as a possible cause of LV systolic dysfunction (thyroxine 29.5 nmol/L, hospital reference interval [HRI] 13–51 nmol/L; thyroid stimulating hormone 0.12 ng/mL, HRI 0.03–0.38 ng/mL), while the latter unveiled MI (0.19 ng/mL, HRI < 0.15 ng/mL) [,].The dog was started on pimobendan (Vetmedin, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim amRhein, Germany) at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg orally every 12 h, and several blood samples were collected with the aim of submitting them for investigation of infections responsible for MI.Initially, serological tests for Borrelia burgdorferi, Dirofilaria immitis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia canis, Leishmania infantum, Toxoplasma gondii and Bartonella henselae infection were performed (SNAP 4Dx, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, U.S.A.; MegaFLUO LEISH, Vetefarma S.r.l., Cuneo, Italy; MegaFLUO TOXOPLASMA Gondii, Vetefarma S.r.l., Cuneo, Italy; Indirect immunofluorescence performed as described by Fabbi et al.[]), yielding negative results.Given the family history as well as the ongoing and still unexplained MI, further serum samples were subsequently submitted for SARS-CoV-2 investigation [,].Different serological assays were performed (using samples collected on the same day) to detect antibodies against the S and the N proteins of SARS-CoV-2.More in detail, specific neutralizing antibodies against the receptor binding domain of the spike protein were determined in serum samples using the SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT, GenScript cPass™ SARS-CoV-2 Neutralisation Antibody Detection Kit, GenScript Biotech Co., Ltd., Leiden, Netherlands) following the manufacturer’s instructions (positivity: ≥30% inhibition).Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay (VNT) was performed as described by Rijkers et al.[] (positivity: titers ≥1/10).Lastly, a commercial multispecies enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; EradikitTM COVID19-Multispecies, In3Diagnostic, Turin, Italy; positivity: >20%) was performed.Pending serological results, no other therapies were prescribed in addition to pimobendan, but exercise restriction was recommended.Within two weeks, results from serological assays became available.All tests yielded a positive result ().\\\\nIn light of such findings, approximately two weeks from presentation, another control was performed to recheck the clinical, cardiological and serological condition of the dog, and to obtain nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 genome detection (using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting E gene, as previously described by Corman et al.[]).The owner reported an improvement in exercise tolerance and no further syncopal episodes.Physical evaluation was unremarkable, with the only exception being the heart murmur, which maintained unchanged characteristics.Echocardiography demonstrated a mild improvement of LV systolic function, although a DCM phenotype and a functional mitral regurgitation were still present, thus explaining the persistence of the heart murmur ().Blood samples were collected to monitor the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as well as the serum concentration of cTnI.All serologic assays were still positive () and cTnI was still over the HRI (0.17 ng/mL).SARS-CoV-2 molecular analysis yielded a negative result.Therapy as well as instruction at home were unchanged, and another recheck was planned within three weeks.\\\\nAt that control, although the clinical and echocardiographic findings were stable compared to the previous examination, and two serological tests were still positive (i.e., sVNT and VNT), cTnI was normalised (0.09 ng/mL) and ELISA yielded a negative result for SARS-CoV-2 ().The dog continued to receive pimobendan and be revaluated regularly over the following weeks, showing a good clinical condition, stable echocardiographic parameters and a cTnI within the HRI.He is still alive and doing well at the time of manuscript writing (9 months from the occurrence of clinical signs and 7 months from the first evaluation at our institution).', 'A 25-year-old female presented to the emergency room with a complaint of left-sided body weakness since 12 hours.On clinical examination, the power of the left upper and lower limbs was seen to be limited to just slight movement.Planter reflex was up going on the left side (Babinski positive).Clinical anemia was also present, and the nails showed massive clubbing.According to her parents, she had a history of cyanosis since birth, but they never got treatment for it.There was no history of any psychiatric illness, hypertension, or diabetes.\\\\nA CT (computed tomography) scan showed no evidence of a haemorrhage, but some changes in the temporoparietal area were observed, as shown in Figure .Later, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with contrast was advised and performed, which showed an infarct of the right temporoparietal lobe with mild brain atrophy as shown in Figure and Figure .', 'A 45-year-old, multiparous, overweight female with a history of OHP use for 13 years (levonorgestrel 0.15 mg and estradiol 0.03 mg daily) consulted the emergency room of our institution following a one-week clinical course of worsening dyspnea, general malaise, headache, and ageusia.At admission, the patient reported dyspnea at rest, associated with intermittent retrosternal oppressive chest pain radiating to the back.The physical exam revealed pulmonary aggregates on auscultation, and her vital signs showed tachypnea, tachycardia, and desaturation.Oxygen therapy was started, requiring a non-rebreathing mask at 12 L/min to maintain adequate oxygen saturation.RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was indicated.Arterial blood gases analysis showed a PAO2/FIO2 ratio of 56, and the patient was then transferred to the respiratory intensive care unit (ICU).\\\\nHer COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed with the positive results of the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (50 copies of RNA/reaction).Laboratory test results showed positive severity predictors, including an elevation of D-dimer (>20 mg/L), troponin I (0.150 ng/mL), ferritin (2934 ng/mL), and lactate dehydrogenase (879 U/L) levels.Other admission paraclinical tests showed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, mild thrombocytopenia, and elevation of transaminases more than three times the laboratory upper limit.Because of the risk of bacterial pneumonia co-infection, ampicillin-sulbactam was started as empiric antibiotic treatment.\\\\nDue to significant elevation of the D-dimer, a CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was taken according to the YEARS protocol.The results of the CTPA showed a massive PTE with compromise to the posterior basal segmental artery of the left lower lobe, inferior lingula, and apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe.An echocardiogram was performed, showing right ventricular dysfunction.Systemic thrombolysis with r-tPA (alteplase) 100 mg infusion over 2 h was administered according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines.\\\\nAfter treatment, the patient showed an improvement in her hemodynamic and ventilatory patterns.Nonetheless, during the hospital stay, the patient displayed additional complications: (1) septic shock secondary to a hospital-acquired infection requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemodynamic support therapy, (2) respiratory failure with invasive mechanical ventilation support requirement and subsequent tracheostomy, and (3) severe anemia with the need for blood transfusions.\\\\nThe patient had an adequate response to treatment with satisfactory clinical evolution, successful extubation, and transfer to the general hospital floor.The patient was evaluated by the OB-GYN attending physician, who contraindicated the further use of estrogenic hormonal contraceptives.Finally, the patient was discharged from our institution with indefinite anticoagulation therapy with a factor-XA inhibitor.The entire hospital stay course is represented in .', 'A 25-year-old man abducted, raped and robbed two women under the influence of alcohol in six months.He reported that his father often physically and psychologically abused him and his mother during his childhood and that a teenager raped him when he was a child.He was unschooled and few years before the rapes he was convicted for having stabbed a man who had insulted him.After having been released, he committed several burglaries.Moreover, he reported to have frequently beaten his wife and to have often fantasized about raping women since he was very young, even if he knew rape was illegal.Finally, he reported to have begun to consume alcohol during his childhood, albeit he never became an alcoholic.\\\\nHence, the court requested a forensic psychiatrist to assess the capacity of the defendant.\\\\nA full clinical/neuropsychological examination was performed.No clinical/electroencephalographical signs of neurological impairment and no signs of alcohol-dependence were observed.An intelligence quotient (IQ) of 59 was found and an antisocial personality disorder was diagnosed.A genetic test focused on five genes (MAOA, COMT, SLC6A4, HTR1B, and DRD4) found a 3-repeat variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) variant of MAOA and a TT genotype for the rs13212041 polymorphism of the HTR1B gene.', 'A four-year-old, previously healthy boy weighing 24 Kg, from Dhaka, was admitted with a four-day history of a high continued fever.He also complained of suffering abdominal pain, loose motions, and emesis for two days.He had no history of flu-like symptoms, cough, or respiratory distress in the past month.There was a history of close contact with a COVID-19 patient (within one month of the illness).He had no history of dengue.On examination, he was found febrile (temperature 102°F), tachypneic, and tachycardic with unrecordable blood pressure.Auscultation of lungs revealed bilateral crepitations with good air entry.The abdomen was distended, flanks were full with mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness.Initial investigations showed dengue NS1 Ag positive and rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 negative, thrombocytopenia, positive C-reactive protein, altered coagulation profiles (Table ).\\\\nThe chest X-ray (CXR) initially revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrations.He was treated for dengue shock syndrome with plasma leakage with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, inotropes, and colloids.On the 5th and 6th day of fever, he developed petechial rashes on both extremities, cheilosis, and an erythematous rash over the trunk (Figure ).\\\\nThe patient also developed a cough and respiratory distress, oxygen saturation (SpO2) by pulse oximeter was found to be 96% with 5L/min oxygen through a face mask.Repeat CXR revealed bilateral inflammatory lesions with pleural effusion.The ECG was normal.However, echocardiography revealed dilated coronary arteries, left main coronary artery (LMCA, +3.0 standard deviation, SD), left coronary artery (LCA, +2.5 SD) with the loss of distal tapering and mild left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] 52%) (Figure ).\\\\nInitial serum ferritin, N-terminal-pro hormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), D-dimer, serum troponin I were markedly raised (as shown in Table ).The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (IgG) test came back positive on the seventh day of fever.A pediatric cardiologist was consulted, and we administered one dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/Kg, along with enoxaparin 2 mg/Kg for five days.Thereafter, oral prednisolone and aspirin were added.Meanwhile, the patient became afebrile, and the rash faded.His general condition improved with a gradual return of appetite.Three days after the IVIG, repeat tests showed decreasing serum ferritin, NT-pro-BNP, and serum troponin I.The patient was transferred to the ward after 12 days in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) thereafter discharged after five days with the necessary advice and follow-up appointment.', 'Patient 3 is a 33-year-old man who is the second child of non-consanguineous parents.He started walking and saying his first words at the age of 2.At the age of 10 years he suffered his first seizure episodes and when he was 22 years old he had a coma episode following a severe seizure crisis.Brain angio-MRI showed temporo-mesial sclerosis, left A1 segment agenesis with origin of the left anterior vertebral artery from the right circle, asymmetry of the supratentorial ventricular system due to the prevalence of the right trigone, and an occipital horn.', 'A 32-year-old male patient with no significant past medical history other than COVID-19 infection, months prior to admission, presented to ED complaining of dysphagia.Symptoms began about 1 week prior to presentation with difficulty swallowing liquids that progressed to involve solids as well.Dysphagia was described by the patient as a choking sensation and that he feels the food getting stuck in his chest.Dysphagia is partially relieved with belching.The patient also reported pyrosis and occasional vomiting.Denied nausea, abdominal pain or any change in bowel habits.On review of systems, the patient endorsed subacute cough for 3-4 weeks duration.The cough was mainly nonproductive and has been worsening since onset.It was associated with shortness of breath.Shortness of breath occurred mainly with exertion and while talking.The patient denied hemoptysis, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, myalgia and arthralgia.\\\\nOn presentation, the patient was afebrile, HR: 94, RR: 19, O2sat: 100% RA and BP: 129/81.Examination revealed mild wheezes over lung bases bilaterally and no palpable lymphadenopathy.The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.Complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were within normal range.Angiotensin-converting enzyme level was elevated at 81 U/L (Normal range 9 - 67 U/L).HIV Ag/Ab screening test was negative as well as COVID-19 PCR test.\\\\nCT-chest with contrast (Figure ) showed prominent mediastinal and bilateral hilar adenopathy, multiple pulmonary nodules, mild interlobular septal thickening, suggesting interstitial pulmonary edema and peripheral left lower lobe ground-glass opacities, which could be pulmonary edema or infection.Esophagram (Figure ) showed findings compatible with extrinsic mass effect involving the middle esophagus, in keeping with bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy noted on CT chest.\\\\nOn the third day of admission, the patient underwent Endobronchial Ultrasound Bronchoscopy (EBUS) with transbronchial needle aspiration.Samples were sent for cytology, pathology and flow cytometry.Flow cytometry was negative for monoclonal B-cells and immuno-phenotypically abnormal T-cells.The pathology report showed abundant non-necrotizing granulomas, mature lymphocytes and endobronchial cells in all biopsied samples.Grocott methenamine silver (GMS) and AFB stains were negative for microorganisms.Fungus and AFB cultures were negative as well.\\\\nThe patient was tolerating PO intake and was discharged from the hospital.The patient followed up with the pulmonology clinic one week after discharge for biopsy results and was started on oral prednisone 40 mg qDay.The patient respiratory symptoms did improve after three months of steroid therapy.Nonetheless, dysphagia persisted.Due to the persistence of dysphagia and as evidence of esophageal compression does not rule out infiltrative involvement.The patient underwent EGD with dilation followed by manometry studies a few months after discharge.The mucosa was grossly and histologically normal.Manometry studies were also unremarkable.The patient reported partial improvement of dysphagia after dilation.The patient is still following up with pulmonology and gastroenterology clinics for further evaluation and management.', 'A 55-year-old Caucasian male, with a past medical history significant for tobacco abuse (41 pack-years), presented with shortness of breath accompanied by chest and back pain for two months.Blood workup showed a WBC count of 68,400 cells/µL, with an AEC of 27,360 cells/µL.A computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was performed, as he was hypoxic, and revealed a 3.6-cm speculated mass within the anterior right upper lobe, partially invading the anterior chest wall.It also revealed mediastinal and hilar adenopathy, an extensive osseous lesion (including compression fracture at T7), and a small pericardial effusion (Figure ).A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed and revealed a diffuse metastatic disease involving the liver, adrenal glands, spleen, and the bones.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine did not reveal spinal cord compression, but it did show the compression fracture at T7 and multilevel thoracic spondylosis.', 'A 29-year old female diagnosed with SLE for 4 years complicated with grade II lupus nephritis presented with status epilepticus.She denied a history of fever on admission, but was treated with cyclophosphamide 1 month prior for an episode of cerebral lupus.She had noticed a papule over the left deltoid region which progressed to an ulcer over 1 week.Fever was noted following several days of hospital admission and the ulcer site became painful.She had worked in paddy fields several months prior to the admission when she was in good health.However, she could not recall any precipitating injury at the affected site during working.She is a mother of two and both pregnancies were uncomplicated.She denied history of alcohol abuse or smoking.\\\\nOn examination she was emaciated and had a GCS score of 15/15 following recovery of status epilepticus.There was no obvious lymphadenopathy.At presentation, the size of the ulcer was about a 3 cm lesion and it gradually developed in to an ulcer with a necrotic center with surrounding erythema.A tentative diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum was made with the appearance of the ulcer (Figure ).It gradually advanced into the underlying muscle over 3 weeks of onset despite the antibiotic treatment.Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory systems, and the abdomen was normal.\\\\nHer full blood count, blood picture, and other supportive investigations showed evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia, which was suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura which resolved following plasmapheresis.Her ESR was persistently normal.Renal functions were stable during hospital stay, so were the liver profile.Chest radiography revealed evidence of bilateral mild pleural effusions and echocardiography revealed a thin rim of pericardial effusion and good cardiac function.MRI, MRA brain showed evidence of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome.', \"A 12-year-old girl developed abdominal pain and reported frequent bloody stools for over a month.She had been diagnosed with moderate left-sided UC at nine years of age.Remission was initially induced with prednisolone, and she remained in remission with azathioprine due to mesalazine intolerance.She experienced moon face and increased appetite as side effects while taking prednisolone.She was later diagnosed with a UC relapse based on colonoscopic findings of marked erythema and the absence of vascular pattern.Because of the side effects of previous prednisolone therapy, the patient and her guardian declined further steroid therapy.We decided to induce remission with GMA.However, securing two blood vessels for GMA was expected to be difficult because of the patient's small anthropometric measurement (height: 134.9 cm, weight: 31.7 kg).Therefore, we elected to perform GMA with the single-needle method.She underwent GMA once per week for 10 weeks.A 17-gauge dialysis puncture needle (outer diameter: 1.4 mm, length: 25 mm) was inserted into the right elbow ().The dialysis console processed a blood flow rate of 40 mL/min (total blood volume: 1,800 mL).In this case, the treatment time was 90 minutes.No decrease in blood pressure was observed during this procedure.Heparin was used as an anticoagulant.All 10 GMA treatments were completed without puncture failure or poor blood removal.Additionally, no side effects were observed.However, the patient did not attain remission with GMA.After an unsuccessful attempt of oral tacrolimus therapy, remission could be achieved and has maintained with infliximab (5 mg/kg, every 8 weeks) for 10 months.\", \"A previously healthy 10-year-old Asian girl presented to the emergency department with headache, vomiting, and one week of mild nonproductive cough.Her headache started the evening prior to presentation, was gradual in onset and frontotemporal in location, and improved with acetaminophen but subsequently woke her from sleep.It was accompanied by two episodes of emesis.On presentation to the ED, the patient described her headache pain as 3 out of 10 in severity.She denied photophobia, had no further nausea, and denied abdominal pain.She reported that the headache worsened with standing and improved with lying down.Review of systems was significant only for pallor.\\\\nThe patient was otherwise healthy with no prior medical issues and taking no regular medications.She was fully vaccinated and had no known allergies.Her family history was significant for frequent headaches in her mother and maternal aunt.She was living with her parents and brother and attending 4th grade.\\\\nVital signs demonstrated blood pressure 111/56, pulse 104, temperature 37.1°C, respiratory rate 22, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air.Initial exam revealed a well-appearing female and was unremarkable including a normal fundoscopic exam and a normal complete neurologic exam.\\\\nThe patient received ibuprofen and oral rehydration and her headache further improved.A presumptive diagnosis of migraine headache was made and was discharged with primary care follow-up the following day.\\\\nTwo days after her initial emergency department visit, the patient returned to the ED with worsening headache, myalgia, subjective fever, and diffuse weakness.The patient's mother reported that the patient was unable to stand or walk and as a result her mother had been carrying her, including to and from the bathroom.The patient endorsed nausea but no further vomiting.\\\\nVital signs demonstrated blood pressure 105/49, pulse 123, temperature 36.9°C, respiratory rate 30, and oxygenation saturation of 97% on room air.On exam, the patient was moderately ill appearing, lying in bed responding slowly to questions.Her lips were noted to be cracked and with some oozing blood.No oral lesions were noted in the mouth.Pupils were equal, round, and sluggishly reactive bilaterally.Neck was supple with no adenopathy noted.Cardiovascularly, she was noted to be tachycardic with a regular rhythm and II/VI flow murmur.Her respiratory exam was normal.Her abdominal exam was benign with no organomegaly.Neurologically the patient was noted to be slow to respond to questions and moving slowly but without focal deficits.She was, however, unable to walk without assistance.Skin exam revealed diffuse ecchymoses on the lower extremities bilaterally.\\\\nLaboratory studies were ordered along with a rapid brain MRI, and pediatric neurology was consulted.\\\\nLaboratory results were as follows: hemoglobin 2.6 g/dL, hematocrit 8.3%, platelets 10K/uL, and WBC 60.5K/uL with 83% blasts in the differential.\", 'A 15-year-old boy came to the emergency department (ED) with a two-day present-ation of abdominal pain, lack of appetite, and vomiting.On examination, the patient was found to have pain and tenderness on the right side of his abdomen.(Clinical, laboratory, radiological, and intraoperative details for all patients are described in .) SARS-CoV-2 was detected via the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) of his nasopharyngeal (NP) swab.Empiric intravenous (IV) antimicrobial treatment with cefotaxime and metronidazole was started and he was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy.', 'A 23-year-old Caucasian male with a history of exercise-induced asthma presented to the emergency department complaining of left-sided chest pain which started two days after receiving the second dose of the mRNA-1273 Moderna vaccine.The patient described the pain as sharp, intermittent with radiation to the left upper back and left arm with 10/10 severity and worsening with deep inspiration.Fever and chills were also present.The patient did not report any recent history of tick bites, upper respiratory symptoms, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), orthopnea, arthralgias or rashes.\\\\nOn physical examination the patient was in no distress, with normal vital signs, normal S1/S2 heart sounds without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops and no jugular vein distention (JVD).There was no palpable tenderness of the chest wall.The lungs were clear to auscultation.There was no pitting edema in the lower extremities.\\\\nDiagnostic testing revealed elevated troponin T of 475ng/L (<22ng/L) which trended upward reaching a peak of 910ng/L (<22ng/L).Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed right axis deviation with left posterior fascicular block without any ST elevations as well as premature atrial contractions (PACs) in trigeminy (Figure ).A bedside ultrasound showed trace pericardial effusion.CT angiography (CTA) of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE).Lyme serology, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and respiratory viral panel were negative and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was normal.Pertinent leukocytosis of 11.09 K/ul (3.8-10.5 K/Ul) with absolute neutrophil count of 8.09 K/uL, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 37mm/hr (0-15mm/hr), c-reactive protein (CRP) of 11.6mg/L (<4.0mg/L).Urine toxicology was positive for recreational marijuana drug use but negative for cocaine use.\\\\nTransthoracic echo (TTE) revealed abnormal motion and increased thickening of the septal wall with preserved ejection fraction (EF) of 65% and normal diastolic function (Video ).Trace pericardial effusion was also noted.Based on the patient’s clinical presentation, ECG, cardiac markers and TTE findings a presumptive diagnosis of peri-myocarditis was made.\\\\nWe did not pursue cardiac MRI since the patient had clinically improved within 48 hrs.', 'A 56 year-old female was transported to the emergency department by EMS after physically threatening her husband with a knife.According to the patient, she experienced altered sensorium for one week prior to presentation, primarily resulting in suicidal and homicidal command hallucinations instructing her to overdose on NSAIDs and kill her husband.She denied any headaches, vertigo, fevers, head trauma, urinary symptoms, or use of illicit substances.There was no history of psychosis, schizophrenia, mania, or depression and a review of her medication list for any potential hallucinogenic agents did not indicate a pharmacologic etiology.Her past medical history was comprised of two prior strokes, the most recent being two years ago that involved the right frontal lobe.MRI of the brain at the time also showed evidence of an old right parietal lobe infarct.', 'A nine day old male newborn was admitted to our hospital due to fever and poor general condition.The pregnancy was complicated by threatened miscarriage and placental abruption.He was born at 36 weeks + 1 day of GA by spontaneous delivery.Perinatal cardiotocographic monitoring was negative.Neonate blood gas analyses and cardiorespiratory adaption were normal, and the Apgar score was 7 and 8 at 1′ and 5′ minutes, respectively.Birth weight was 2950 g.The subsequent early postnatal period was complicated by transient hypoglycemia; neonatal clinical assessment was normal, postnatal weight loss was within normality range (<10%), and the neonate was discharged on the fourth day of life.The mother was tested for SARS-CoV-2 at admission in the obstetric ward with a negative result and a positive result at discharge, without any symptoms.At day nine, the baby developed fever (38 °C) and poor feeding.\\\\nThe nasopharyngeal swab, tested for SARS-CoV-2 by qualitative realtime PCR (AllplexTM SARS-CoV-2 Assay, Seegene), was positive; thus, he was admitted to our COVID-19 center.In the subsequent 24 h, he developed progressive respiratory failure and diarrhea with enterorrhagia and was admitted to the PICU.Surgical evaluation with abdominal X-ray and ultrasound excluded the suspicion of volvulus or necrotizing enterocolitis; echocardiography and electrocardiogram were normal although the N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and Troponin T (TnT) were elevated ().\\\\nThe baby was supported with noninvasive ventilation, and treatment with antibiotic wide coverage (ampicillin plus gentamycin plus metronidazole) was started.In the subsequent days, the neurological condition deteriorated with impaired consciousness and pathological spontaneous motricity, and we observed worsening of respiratory failure leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation on day three.The chest radiograph and CT scan showed a picture of bilateral interstitial pneumonia with an extensive area of atelectasis in the basal site.\\\\nOn the nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed by quantitative realtime PCR (Quanty COVID-19 assay, Clonit Srl, Milan, Italy), revealing a high viral load at admission ().\\\\nSARS-CoV-2 variant determination was performed by realtime PCR single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) detection approach (COVID-19 Variant Catcher, Clonit Srl, Milan, Italy, CE IVD).N501Y mutation and HV69-70 deletion, suggesting VOC 202012/01 Lineage B.1.1.7 variant (also known as UK variant), were detected.Thus, we started anti SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune plasma day three and four, plus dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg/die and remdesivir 2.5 mg/kg day 5 and 1.25 mg/kg for nine more days.\\\\nBecause of the neurological impairment, a lumbar puncture was performed and was normal, with negative microbiological results including SARS-CoV-2.The metabolic test on blood and liquor were normal.Immunological screening showed no abnormalities.The EEG showed hypovolted brain electrical activity with a discontinuous pattern; no electrographic or electroclinical seizure was recorded.The cerebral CT scan was normal; the brain MRI showed deep medullary vein thrombosis associated with cytotoxic edema in the deep periventricular white matter (fan-shaped configuration) (, and ), thus, treatment with enoxaparin 100 UI/kg q 12 was started.\\\\nThe clinical condition progressively improved; after thirteen days the baby was extubated and in four more days became oxygen independent, able to feed on the breast, with neurological and EEG improvement.', 'The proband, a 2-year-old Russian girl at the time of the last clinical evaluation, was admittedto the neurological department with repeated, prolonged myoclonic, and generalized seizures responsive only to intravenous injection of diazepam.She was the fourth child of healthy parents from a non-consanguineous marriage.The proband has three healthy siblings ().During the pregnancy, a risk of miscarriage was observed at 12 weeks of gestation.Delivery and neonatal period were unremarkable.At the age of 4 months, during obstructive bronchitis, she developed an absence seizure with apnea 3–5 s long that repeated daily afterward.At the age of 5 months, during hot water bathing, the proband had a prolonged generalized myoclonic seizure for 40 min that was responsive only to diazepam injection.Similar episodes repeated every 7–10 days without any provoking factors.\\\\nOn brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), periventricular leukomalacia was noted and was considered as a result of ischemic brain injury with no relevance to the epileptic phenotype of the patient.', 'A 42-year-old female presented to us with a primary complaint of pain in the left side of her face for 3 yrs.The pain was spontaneous and oppressive in nature.She had a history of burning, a pricking type of dysesthesia (pins and needles feeling), intermittent in nature and radiated to the left temporal and orbital region.The unremitting nature of pain often made her feel anxious and agitated with lack of sleep.No trigger factors and aggravating or relieving factors were disclosed in the history.She narrated a history of uneventful extraction of a decayed upper third molar and a restoration of carious tooth citing as a possible source of pain by her dentist.\\\\nHer medical history was unremarkable except the ingestion of a cocktail of medicines alternating from analgesics, antibiotics, steroids, and antidepressants prescribed by multiple physicians for the unremitting chronic pain she was experiencing.An array of investigations was performed ranging from MRI brain, OPG, and cephalograms that turned out to be inconclusive.', 'We describe the case of an 18-year-old boy presented with ASD associated with a mild intellectual disability (patient 5 in the tables).Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.Regarding the familial load, the paternal uncle presents an anxiety disorder treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.\\\\nThe proband is the first child of unrelated and healthy parents.He attended school with support, had good global functioning and social relationships with classmates, despite his social anxiety, and had progressive improvements in his social skills.\\\\nAt the age of 13 years old, after his summer break, social isolation acutely worsened, associated with a confusional state, psychomotor agitation, speech impairment, visual hallucinations, cognitive regression, a loss of personal autonomy, and increased anxiety.Quetiapine up to 300 mg/day and alprazolam 0.50 mg/day were prescribed, with complete recovery.Cerebral MRI and metabolic tests were unremarkable.', 'A 77-year-old woman was hospitalized in the cardiology department due to atrial fibrillation.Contraindications were excluded, and atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation was performed on an optional schedule.However, abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan found a circular and low-density lesion in the Segment 4 of the liver with unclear border, approximately 15 mm× 12 mm in size, which was mild progressive enhanced in the arterial phase and portal phase.HCC was suspected, but no hepatic cirrhosis and history of hepatitis ().Tumor markers, including CEA, CA199, CA125, AFP, were within normal range, hepatitis panel was negative, and hepatic function was normal.\\\\nTo confirm the diagnosis, the patient underwent further examinations.Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed one nodule in the segment 7, one nodule in the segment 5, and two nodules in the segment 4 of the liver (4, 6, 17, and 6 mm in diameter), respectively.', 'Case 1 was a 2-year-old boy who was admitted to the department of hemato-oncology due to pallor without respiratory symptoms or signs including no hemoptysis.Laboratory results revealed severe anemia, and his chest radiograph and chest computed tomography scans revealed pulmonary hemorrhage as the focus of bleeding ().The patient was diagnosed with IPH and treated with corticosteroids.His clinical course was uneventful and the corticosteroid dose was gradually tapered after the first month of treatment.However, he was re-admitted due to hemoptysis.Although he had no history of allergy and low levels of specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E to cow’s milk, Heiner syndrome was nevertheless suspected, and milk avoidance was recommended.The patient has been adhering to a strict milk restriction diet and has not had any further hemorrhagic events, and is not taking corticosteroids.', 'A 16-year-old boy with a family history of seizures (mother, cousin) exhibited typical development until the age of 14; this was the point at which he developed generalized epilepsy, which was well-controlled using valproic acid (VPA).He also had a family history of high blood lactate levels (mother) and a history of easy fatigability.At the age of 16, he developed tachypnoea and tachycardia.Serum glucose and lactate levels were elevated to 12.5 and 9.4 mmol/L, respectively.Urine tests for glucose and ketones were positive (3+ and 2+, respectively).Arterial blood gas analysis in room air revealed elevated lactate levels (9.4 mmol/L) and low pH (7.23).His glycosylated hemoglobin A1 (HbA1c) level was 14.60%.He was diagnosed with diabetes, ketoacidosis, and generalized epilepsy.However, his high lactate levels and tachycardia persisted following treatment for hyperglycaemia, fluid resuscitation, and correction of acidosis.Several days later, his tachypnoea returned, and he also developed limb weakness and external ophthalmoplegia.After 1 week, he developed severe respiratory acidosis and respiratory failure type II, for which he required intubation and artificial ventilation.Tracheotomy was performed after several failed attempts to discontinue artificial ventilation.\\\\nUpon admission, neurological examination revealed external ophthalmoplegia, mild limb weakness, and pyramidal signs.However, he exhibited no signs of myoclonus or cognitive abnormalities.Laboratory testing revealed an increase in plasma lactate (9.4 mmol/L, normal <2.3), pyruvate (D-3-hydroxybutyrate, 0.35 mmol/L, normal 0.03–0.30 mmol/L), and glucose (12.5 mmol/L, normal <7.0 mmol/L) levels.Fasting plasma insulin and 30 min and 2 h post-prandial insulin values were 112.54, 298.03, and 73.34 μU/mL, respectively.Creatine kinase levels were normal.Arterial blood gas analysis indicated severe respiratory acidosis.His mother also exhibited increase in resting and post-exercise blood lactate levels (2.7 and 9.7 mmol/L, respectively).Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed slight increase in intracranial pressure, normal white and red cell counts, glucose levels, and protein levels.Bacterial cultures were negative, and no abnormal cells were detected.\\\\nElectrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia.Normal structure and ejection fraction were observed via echocardiography.Electroencephalography revealed moderate abnormalities, without spikes or sharp waves.Electromyography revealed mild axonal damage and demyelination, as well as abnormal F waves.\\\\nHigh-density computed tomography (CT) signals were observed in the great cerebral vein (arrow in Figure ), sagittal sinus (arrow in Figures ), torcular herophili (arrow in Figure ), and transverse sinus (arrow in Figure ).Thrombus formation had not been excluded at this stage.High-density CT signals were also observed in the cerebral falx (hollow arrow in Figure ), which was suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage.However, results of CT angiography taken 2 days after fluid resuscitation were normal.\\\\nAfter 1 month, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure ) revealed areas of high signal intensity in the lateral ventricle, periaqueductal gray matter (bilateral hypothalamus and midbrain tegmentum, arrow in Figures ), and medullary tegmentum (arrow in Figure ).', 'A 35-year-old male patient presented with a six-month history of pain in the anterior chest and neck.His pain initially had been mild but had become severe in the last three weeks.He was afebrile and did not have any constitutional symptoms.On examination, marked tenderness of the right sternoclavicular joint was noted.Initial laboratory investigations, tuberculosis workup, and chest X-rays were unremarkable.However, further study with MRI revealed subchondral bone marrow edema and enhancement involving the medial end of the right clavicle.', 'A 77-year-old man presented with an 11-day history of back pain, bilateral lower extremity pain, and numbness at the back of the right foot.He was transferred to our hospital by ambulance because of exacerbation.He had received anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy after extrasystole and brain infarction for 2 years.There was no history of trauma or any invasive procedure.Walking gait was stable with the use of a stick.Neurological examination showed no abnormality except for a positive result in the straight-leg-raising test for the right leg.Laboratory data did not indicate coagulopathy-related diseases.We used a previously published protocol for differential diagnosis (Table ).[ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 7 days after the first medical examination, and it showed a spinal SDH extending from L4 to S1 (Fig.', 'The patient is a 28-year-old male with prior history of a grade 3 astrocytoma, who presented to our emergency department (ED) after having a general tonic-clonic seizure (GTC).Initially, his disease was appreciated four years prior when he presented with a GTC and was found to have a grade 3 astrocytoma of the left occipital lobe (Figure ).He underwent maximal safe resection followed by adjuvant EBRT to 45 Gy in 25 fractions at an outside institution.Due to reasons outside the patient’s control, he received only two cycles of adjuvant temozolomide following EBRT.He developed disease recurrence, presenting as a GTC six months prior to this ED presentation, where imaging demonstrated tumor progression with increased extension into the parietal lobe (Figure ).He subsequently underwent a second maximal safe resection later that month.Final pathology returned as GB.Follow-up imaging four months afterward demonstrated disease progression and he was started on bevacizumab as well as a tumor treatment field (TTF) device.He unfortunately only tolerated TTFs for one month, ending one month prior to the ED presentation.\\\\nUpon admission to our hospital from the ED, MRI demonstrated progression of disease in the left occipital-parietal lobes with extension into the splenium and anterior-inferior extension into the left thalamus and basal ganglia (Figure ).', 'A 64-year-old Caucasian female presented to our emergency department (ED) with a two-day history of bleeding from her left breast.She has had a slowly enlarging growth on her left breast for the past two years, which initially started as a small papular lesion in the nipple areolar complex.Most recently, the mass became ulcerated with active serous discharge; however, due to the lack of health insurance, the patient did not seek any medical attention.For the past two days prior to presentation, she developed significant bleeding and oozing from the ulcerated mass, forcing her to report to the ED.There was associated localized breast pain, but no weight loss, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, cough, blurry vision, nor headaches.\\\\nShe had no prior personal or family history of skin and breast cancers.She had no history of excessive exposure to sunlight, radiation exposure, arsenic ingestion, or a history of immunosuppression.\\\\nPhysical examination reveals an elderly female in no apparent distress.Vital signs were stable apart from an elevated blood pressure of 164/85 mmHg. Examination of the left breast revealed a large fungating mass of >10 cm in size, occupying most of the mid and outer breast with a distortion of the nipple areolar complex ().There were several open wounds with active bleeding and a foul smell.The area of erythema was noted.There were palpable left axillary lymph nodes.The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\\\\nThe provisional diagnosis was breast cancer with possible metastasis.Subsequently, the patient underwent workup to further characterize the mass and assess for metastasis.Computer tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was positive for a large, partially enhancing heterogeneous mass in the left breast and a calcified granuloma in the right lung field, in addition to mildly enlarged left axillary lymph nodes.No evidence of metastasis was identified in the abdomen and pelvis.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast was negative for brain lesions.', 'A 62-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our department in June 2020.He was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma in 2010 and treated with an R-CHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) for six cycles, achieving complete response; in 2017, because of a disease recurrence, he was treated with six chemotherapy cycles with R-bendamustine, followed by maintenance therapy only with rituximab for 2 years.The last administration was in February 2020.Clinical and radiological follow-up was negative; during the maintenance therapy, the patient had urinary tract recurring infections, gingivitis, and herpes zoster cutaneous reactivation.\\\\nHe sought medical attention because of progressive vision loss.His pharmacological therapy included atorvastatin, amlodipine, and pantoprazole.He was afebrile; his vital signs were in range.General and neurological physical examination was negative, except for right homonymous hemianopia.Brain computed tomography (CT) showed an uneven cortical and subcortical hypodense lesion in the left posterior temporal and occipital areas, with no contrast enhancement.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the left parenchymal lesion, composed of two parts: a periventricular one showing inhomogeneous signal (decrease in T1-weighted, increase in T2-weighted sequences); and a more uniform one, involving white matter and characterized by strong T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity.', 'A 78-year-old female with past medical history including autoimmune hepatitis, hypothyroidism.She presented to the hospital via emergency medical services with left arm weakness and jerky movements.This event was witnessed by family while she was eating.No recent trauma or fall.No earache, hearing loss, or discharge.No loss of consciousness reported.Of note, she is on azathioprine for autoimmune hepatitis.She was evaluated by the stroke team upon arrival.Vital signs included: elevated blood pressure at 153/72 mmHg, normal pulse 91, and normal respiratory rate at 17.She was afebrile.Laboratory work up revealed normal white cell count (WBC) of 7.2 109/L, and normal hemoglobin of 12 gm/dL.Platelets noted to be low at 80 109/L.Serum chemistry was unremarkable except for low sodium of 129 mEq/L.Urine toxicology drug screen was negative.COVID-19 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test was negative.\\\\nA Computed Tomography (CT) head on admission revealed left temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, right frontal sulcal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and left parietal sulcal subarachnoid hemorrhage.Vessel images with Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) head and neck revealed extensive venous sinus thrombosis involving superior sagittal sinus, bilateral transverse, and sigmoid sinuses.She subsequently underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast and Magnetic Resonance Venogram (MRV) which confirmed extensive venous sinus thrombosis and multicompartment bleeding.', 'This 7-year-old girl is the only child of non-consanguineous parents.She was born at 39 weeks of gestational age via an urgent cesarean section due to maternal premature rupture of the membranes (PROM).At birth, she presented respiratory distress and her Apgar scores were 51 and 85.Her birth weight was 3550 g (75th centile), her length was 53 cm (90th centile), and her OFC 36.5 cm (around 98th centile).Soon after birth, she developed spontaneous tremors of the upper limbs, axial hypotonia, and apnea episodes treated with phenobarbital and oxygen, respectively.A brain ultrasound and MRI were normal.', 'Case 3 was a female child aged 8 years and 7 months.She had visited the hospital with a chief complaint of cold water pain in the left side of the maxilla.The left upper second primary molar was extracted because of apical periodontitis and root resorption due to severe caries, at 4 years of age.There was no past medical history.Dark brown hypomineralization was observed on the buccal tooth surface of the first premolars ().The patient also complained of pain from air blowing and cold water, and the VAS value was 4.Immediately after the treatment to suppress the hypersensitivity, her VAS was zero.When patient came to the hospital one month later, her VAS score showed 1; therefore, the treatment was reapplied.During the seventh treatment, the hypersensitivity improved, and the VAS was 0.The dark brownish tooth surface of the first premolars was changed to pale brown ().Digital analysis significantly reduced the area of the brownish tint from 4858 to 1755 ().On the other hand, cloudiness was not detected.', \"A 26-year-old female presented to our hospital with a primary complaint of intermittent, progressive right upper quadrant abdominal pain of one week's duration, which coincided with the onset of darkened urine and yellowing of the eyes.There was mild nausea, but no emesis.The patient had no subjective fever or rashes.She perceived no significant swelling or unusual bleeding.She had no chest pain or myalgia.Her appetite was normal.\\\\nThe past medical history was notable for a diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma by bronchoscopic biopsy of a right lower lobe radiographic consolidation four months prior to this presentation.By immunohistochemistry, the adenocarcinoma expressed cytokeratin 7, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and napsin-A, but did not express cytokeratin 20, GATA-3, or PAX8, findings consistent with adenocarcinoma of lung origin.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the primary tumor showed cytogenetic evidence of a ROS1 gene rearrangement.No actionable mutations were detected by exon-targeted sequencing.Staging positron emission tomography-computed tomography studies revealed a fludeoxyglucose- (FDG-) avid right lower lobe lung mass with additional consolidation/nodularity in the right middle lobe, left upper lobe, and lingula, and no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy; however, endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy of a level ten lymph node showed involvement by metastatic disease.MRI of the brain showed no evidence of intracranial metastasis.\\\\nGiven the presence of a ROS1 gene rearrangement, the patient was started on oral crizotinib therapy (250 mg twice daily) 10 weeks prior to her presentation.\", 'A 63-year-old white man with no significant comorbidities was diagnosed as having mRCC affecting his right kidney with metastatic spread in the Th11 vertebra and multiple pulmonary sites (Figs.–, ).He underwent a cytoreductive nephrectomy in December 2015.A histological examination was consistent with clear cell carcinoma, predominantly grade 2–3 (focally grade 4) with small areas of sarcomatoid differentiation and necrosis.The tumor stage was assessed as pT1b pN1 cM1.He was sent to the Comprehensive Cancer Center of the University Hospital in Hradec Králové, where he started therapy with sunitinib (50 mg daily, 4 weeks on/2 weeks off schedule) in December 2015.Considering the bone metastases, treatment with denosumab was started simultaneously.Owing to poor tolerability (nausea, fatigue, and anorexia) of the treatment, the schedule was changed to 2 weeks on/1 week off.Due to progressive back pain, combined analgesic therapy with opiates was required (oxycodone, transdermal fentanyl patches).Disease progression was documented in his lungs and spine after 4 months on sunitinib in April 2016.His progressive back pain resulted in hospital admission to perform analgesic radiotherapy to the Th 9–12 area with a dose of 20 Gy in five fractions on 5 consecutive days.He developed diarrhea during the hospitalization.A possible infectious etiology was ruled out with microbiological stool examination, as well as examination for Clostridium difficile and its toxin, and he was started on symptomatic therapy with an antidiarrheal treatment (diphenoxylate hydrochloride 2.5 mg three times a day) and probiotics.\\\\nAfter finishing radiotherapy, nivolumab therapy was started in May 2016 within an expanded access program at an absolute dose of 300 mg every 14 days.Both diarrhea and back pain were gradually resolving during treatment, enabling dose reduction of the opiates.Our patient completed a total of six doses of nivolumab with no laboratory or clinical signs of adverse effects.\\\\nHowever, 14 days following the last dose of nivolumab, he reported a change in behavior and a history of uncontrollable movements.His family started to say that he was strange and restless.He personally felt very well when taking nivolumab and the pain was even improving.He was fully aware of the uncontrollable movements, and although he could think rationally, he was not able to influence or stop them.\\\\nThere was no family history of neurological or mental illness, and he denied any head trauma or neurological disorders in the past.A physical neurological examination revealed no significant findings in his head and peripheral nerves, but there were mild generalized choreatic movements of his upper extremities and head.A psychiatrist described our patient as cooperative, with pronounced choreatic movements of the entire body.His behavior was described as social, without signs of hostility or aggression, and at a reasonable psychomotor tempo.His mood was described as mildly dysphoric in response to the current situation of somatic manifestations.Laboratory tests showed no marked abnormalities.The only medication he was on at that time was a transdermal fentanyl patch (100 mcg/hour changed every 3 days), and he intermittently used antidiarrheal medications (diphenoxylate hydrochloride 2.5 mg or probiotics based on Lactobacillus acidophilus metabolites); during the sunitinib treatment, he irregularly used metoclopramide 10 mg, but he denied any history of neuroleptic use.Because of a serious suspicion of a possible side effect associated with immunotherapy, he was admitted to our hospital on 11 August 2016.A general overview of the timeline of the case report is shown in an additional file (see Additional file ).\\\\nCT (computed tomography) of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed signs of tumor regression in his lungs and bones (Figs.–, ).CT of his brain ruled out brain lesions or infiltrative brain damage.Because of the deterioration of choreatic movements, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain was performed.', 'A 36-year old woman was referred to a tertiary unit at 29+5 weeks of gestation due to fetal cardiomegaly and mild ascites (Fig.a, b), which was detected on a scan undertaken for suspected small for gestational age.The woman was nulliparous with a low-risk first trimester combined screening test and unremarkable anomaly scan.She was rhesus B negative and underwent non-invasive prenatal testing that determined the rhesus genotype of the fetus to be rhesus B negative.Otherwise, no red blood cell antibodies were reported.Of note, the maternal grandmother was known to have sideroblastic anaemia that was diagnosed at 17 years of age.The mother of the unborn fetus and her brother had undergone testing as children but were told that no further follow-up was needed.Unfortunately, additional information regarding and genetic testing for this family history was not available.The woman had mild macrocytic anaemia with haemoglobin of 10.4 g/dl and a mean corpuscular volume of 104 fl.The woman had not received any preconceptional or genetic counselling.\\\\nUpon arrival, the first scan in our department demonstrated a middle cerebral arterial (MCA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) value above 1.5 Multiples of the Median (MoM).Fetal biometry was normal, as was the amniotic fluid index and umbilical artery doppler.Dexamethasone for fetal lung maturation was administered, and an uncomplicated in utero fetal blood transfusion (IUT) was performed at 30+3 weeks of gestation.The pre-transfusion fetal haemoglobin was 4.4 g/dl, which was increased to 14.1 g/dl following 120 mL of blood transfusion through the intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein (Fig.).Investigations to determine the underlying cause of fetal anaemia included microarray comparative genomic hybridization, serology to exclude congenital infection, a peripheral blood film and fetal bilirubin to detect haemolysis.These preliminary investigations were normal.A fetal MRI brain was performed, which showed no abnormalities.', 'This 57-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, heavy dry cough, and fever 6 days after testing positive for COVID-19.Initially, he was able to exercise and sit in a chair with a physical therapist, but progressive respiratory failure necessitated intubation and proning.The patient had large amounts of bronchial mucus and required regular suctioning along with respiratory therapy.Secretions were assessed with pulmonary auscultation (presence of crackles) and by analyzing expiratory flow on the ventilator (sawtooth pattern).When suctioning failed to improve these clinical signs, 1 to 2 physical therapists used manual airway clearance techniques.The goal of these techniques was to sufficiently increase expiratory flow for effective airway clearance while avoiding alveolar collapse.To achieve this, manual compressions on the chest and abdomen were performed with just enough intensity to modify expiratory flow.After extubation, the patient was still unable to effectively clear his mucus due to weak cough.He continued to need intensive manual airway clearance techniques, nasal rinsing to induce cough and to help expectoration as well as upper and lower airway suctioning.To this end, the patient was treated up to 6 times per day/night.Additional physical therapist interventions included passive range of motion, assisted exercising, and mobilization.At the time of writing, the patient was still in the ICU without ventilatory support.', 'A 35-year-old G4P1 pregnant woman who had 1 natural birth and 2 induced abortions.The results of non-invasive prenatal gene detection at 19+2 weeks of gestation suggested that the risk of trisomy 21 (–1.249), trisomy 18 (–1.534), and trisomy 13 (–1.904) were all at low levels.Ultrasound examination at 21+2 weeks of gestation revealed that there is a single live fetus with a gestational age of 21+2 weeks in utero, whereas it is difficult to determine whether the fetus has only 1 umbilical artery to supply blood.The measurement indexes of fetal development are as follows: biparietal diameter = 4.9 cm, femur long = 3.6 cm, and the deepest amniotic fluid was 5.7 cm.The couple requested amniocentesis, chromosome karyotype analysis, and CNVs to further confirm the diagnosis.\\\\nChromosome karyotype analysis after amniocentesis showed that the fetal chromosome karyotype was 46, XY, del (18) (q22.2; q23) (Fig.A).CNV detection results showed that this sample detected chromosome aneuploidy or CNVs of more than 100 kb, which was regarded as the definite pathogenic genomic: seq [hg19] del (18) (q22.1q23), chr18: g.6602000178020000del (Fig.B, C).\\\\nAfter half a year, the personnel of the prenatal diagnosis center followed up the 2 couples and learned that both couples voluntarily terminated their pregnancy after knowing the results of amniocentesis.', 'A 61-year-old male patient presented to the emergency room (ER) on account of a 3-month history of hemoptysis as well as a 2-week history of right upper extremity weakness and numbness.\\\\nHemoptysis was associated with pleuritic right-sided chest pain as well as orthopnea and had been previously treated with two courses of empiric antibiotics and steroids at an outside hospital without improvement prompting his presentation to our emergency room.\\\\nWeakness and numbness of the right upper extremity were initially associated with a painful right palmar rash which was resolved with self-administered topical corticosteroids at home.\\\\nPast medical history was significant for untreated latent tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed about forty years prior to this presentation as well as coronary artery disease requiring stent placement twice in the past.\\\\nOn presentation, the patient was not in acute distress but was tachycardic at 100 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of 16 cycles per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100 percent on room air.Blood pressure was 144/87 millimeters of mercury, and temperature was 99 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\nOn physical examination, he was afebrile and had normal breath sounds and heart sounds without murmurs.Neurological examination was notable for reduced sensation to light but not crude touch over the right hand with reduced strength of 4/5 in that in same extremity.Laboratory studies were significant for a white blood cell count of 18,400 per microliter with 76.3 percent neutrophils, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 90 millimeters per hour, and a C-reactive protein level of 167 milligrams per liter.\\\\nImaging done on admission revealed multifocal lung opacities () concerning for community-acquired multifocal pneumonia (possibly secondary to a resistant organism as patient had completed courses of cefdinir and levofloxacin at the outside hospital without resolution of his symptoms).Other considerations were for possible septic emboli of undetermined source as well as reactivated pulmonary tuberculosis given his long-standing history of latent TB with multiple positive skin purified protein derivative tests in the past.\\\\nCT scan of the head without contrast was concerning for a possible infarct of unclear age, and a follow-up MRI revealed possible abscess collection (Figures and ).\\\\nHe was initially placed on airborne isolation with empiric first-line antituberculosis agents (which were discontinued after 6 negative acid-fast bacilli sputum samples were obtained) as well as empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) for possible multifocal pneumonia, based on recommendations of the infectious disease consultants.', 'Case 1 was a female child aged 7 years and 11 months.She had visited the hospital with a chief complaint of cold water pain in the anterior mandible.She had a history of trauma to the anterior primary teeth, including the lower right central incisor, right lateral incisor, and left lateral incisor, at 3 years of age.Hypomineralized areas, brownish-white in color, were observed on the labial side of her lower bilateral central incisors ().There was no past medical history.Genetic screening was not performed; the permanent tooth hypomineralization was thought to be caused by primary tooth trauma.The patient also complained of pain from air blowing and cold water, and the VAS value was 6.5. Immediately after the treatment to suppress the hypersensitivity, she no longer experienced pain with air or cold water, and VAS was zero.When patient came to the hospital one month later, her VAS score showed 4; therefore, the treatment was reapplied.After the fourth treatment, the hypersensitivity had not completely disappeared, and the VAS was 1.For the seventh treatment, patients’ VAS value of hypersensitivity pain were stable at 0.5–0.Furthermore, the surface of the brownish tooth had changed to appear almost cloudy after seventh treatment ().During the process of this treatment, discolored devitalized teeth, gingival inflammation and percussion pain did not appear.Digital analysis indicated a pre-treatment cloudiness of 6331 pixels, which was significantly reduced to 65 pixels after treatment ().In addition, the area of brown color decreased by approximately six-fold, from 12,898 to 2118 pixels.These results suggest that both cloudiness and brown color disorder were significantly improved.', \"In 2006, a 44-year-old woman developed a mass on the left breast with no other clinical symptoms.Excisional biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma.Modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer was then conducted.The postoperative pathological report indicated no evidence of residual cancer and no lymph node involvement (0 of 10).Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive expression of ER (approximately 60%) and PR (approximately 30%) but negative expression of human epidermal factor receptor 2 (HER2).The clinical stage was T1N0M0 (IA).Six cycles of cyclophosphamide + adriamycin + fluorouracil (CAF) chemotherapy were administered.Following CAF chemotherapy, the patient was given toremifene ET until the disease progressed (i.e., relapsed) in 2010.\\\\nIn June 2010, a tumor was found in the right lower lobe of the lung during routine follow-up.A wedge excision biopsy was conducted, and the tumor was determined to be metastatic lung cancer secondary to breast cancer.Immunohistochemical analysis results were similar to those of the original primary tumor (ER+, approximately 70%; PR+, approximately 30%; and HER2+, 0%).After undergoing an ovariectomy, the patient began exemestane treatment to control the disease.\\\\nIn March 2014, the patient complained of severe stimulating dry cough.Computed tomography (CT) identified metastases in the lungs and the mediastinal lymph nodes.Meanwhile, a left renal mass was found and was considered to be malignant.However, the patient did not complain of hematuria or flank pain and refused a biopsy to obtain a definite pathological diagnosis.From April 2014 onward, several chemotherapy regimens were employed sequentially to control the disease, but all eventually failed.These regimens included paclitaxel combined with capecitabine, vinorelbine combined with epirubicin, gemcitabine combined with cisplatin, and pemetrexed monotherapy.In August 2015, the patient's symptoms became more severe, and the patient presented with bloody phlegm.Multiple bone metastases were subsequently confirmed via single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).\\\\nTo obtain real-time information about the tumor to inform subsequent treatment, a biopsy was recommended, and the patient consented.A CT-guided needle biopsy of the metastatic lesion in the left lung was performed.Lung metastasis of the breast cancer was confirmed (Fig.).Interestingly, the immunohistochemical analysis showed increased expression of ER (approximately 90% +).On the basis of these findings, the patient began to take the selective ER downregulator (SERD) fulvestrant (500 mg) and zoledronic acid (4 mg) injections starting on August 19, 2015.Two months later, the subjective symptoms (i.e., dry cough and bloody phlegm) were markedly improved, and a partial response was achieved according to the RECIST criteria (Fig.).Remarkably, the left renal mass also shrank, which confirmed the original metastatic diagnosis (Fig.).No significant side effects were observed during the treatment administration of fulvestrant.The patient kept taking an intramuscular injection of fulvestrant (500 mg) every month until December 20, 2016, and CT results showed that the tumor had been stable for 16 months.\\\\nThe patient decided to stop taking fulvestrant in late December 2016 and also refused to undergo any medical examination until the patient developed a severe cough in November 2017.Meanwhile, intracranial metastases were found by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\", 'A 70-year-old man was referred to our institution by his family doctor for the examination of repeated upper abdominal pain.Preoperative computed tomography (CT) suggested resectable pancreatic cancer of the pancreatic body (Fig.A) concomitant with stricture of the CA root (Fig.B), which may have been caused by median arcuate ligament (MAL).Pancreaticoduodenectomy with division of the MAL was scheduled.Unexpected bleeding around the CA was observed during surgery, which may have been caused by the injury incurred when the MAL was cut to release CA compression (Fig.A, B).As bleeding could be controlled by simple compression only, hemostasis by suturing was attempted first.Contrary to our expectations, the bleeding intensified, making it difficult to confirm the bleeding point.Therefore, we attempted supraceliac aortic cross-clamping (SAC) to manage bleeding.To expose the aorta, the crus of the diaphragm was divided, and the aorta was clamped upstream of the CA by a Fogarty vascular-clamp forceps.After performing SAC, the bleeding intensity significantly decreased and a defect of the adventitia measuring 7 mm in diameter on the CA was confirmed (Fig.C).The defect was repaired using a 4-0 Prolene continuous suture (Johnson & Johnson K.K, NJ, USA).The procedure time for SAC was 2 min and 51 s, and the intraoperative blood loss was 480 ml.The maximum blood pressure increased from 120 to 150 mmHg when SAC was performed and then decrease to 120 mmHg after releasing the clamp.The operative policy was changed to underdo distal pancreatectomy to decrease the risk of hepatic infarction.The patient was discharged uneventfully on postoperative day 19.A surgical procedure of SAC is shown in Additional file .', 'A 55-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and unspecified autoimmune disease who presented with acute onset of confusion as well as concrete visual hallucinations and behavioral change.There were no reports of any headache, fever, or stroke-like symptoms.His only outpatient medications were insulin and low-dose steroids.\\\\nThe patient was initially admitted to an outside hospital where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed multifocal areas of restricted diffusion with areas of corresponding T2 hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences (Figure ).', 'A 59-year-old Lithuanian male presented to our department due to deterioration of cognitive functions that had been observed for 2–3 years and gotten worse over the past three days.The patient could not perform some simple tasks in everyday life and lost his previous interests.He maintained some independence though, such as being able to go to the supermarket and do housework unsupervised.Past medical history was significant for dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension, and stroke at the age of 36 with mild right hemiparesis.He also experienced several episodes of aphasia, which could be considered as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).The patient had a history of smoking for a long time.He was born full-term and healthy; his parents, four siblings, and two offspring did not have any relevant health problems and no hereditary diseases were identified among family members.On neurological examination, mild bilateral dysmetria was observed and the mental examination revealed executive dysfunction and pronounced cognitive slowing.Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 25, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) score was 5, phonemic fluency (words beginning with P) was 4 in one minute, and semantic fluency (animals) was 3 in one minute.Laboratory blood tests revealed significant dyslipidaemia (total cholesterol level—7.55 mmol/L, low-density lipoprotein level—5.82 mmol/L).Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable.Low grade bilateral internal and external carotid artery stenosis was detected on carotid ultrasound.Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed communicating hydrocephalus, most likely due to brain atrophy and secondary brain changes, with no obvious cause of obstruction in the ventricles (Huckman index was equal to 66; the width of the third ventricle was equal to 10 mm), and extensive leukoencephalopathy, Fazekas scale score 2–3, lacunar lesions in the dorsal part of pons, thalamus bilaterally, and right cerebellar hemisphere ().\\\\nSince the patient developed early onset progressive dementia, had a stroke at a young age, several TIAs, and brain MRI was significant for extensive leukoencephalopathy, genetic testing by next generation sequencing for inherited cerebral small vessel disease was performed.', 'A 25-year-old man, with no known comorbidities but with a known history of intravenous drug abuse (heroin) from the age of 18, presented with a concern of fever and sore throat lasting two days and an altered level of consciousness lasting one day.According to the patient’s attendant, he was in his usual state of health two days prior when he developed a high-grade fever associated with a sore throat.Furthermore, patient’s attendant mentioned that he was found in an altered state of consciousness along with fecal and urinary incontinence.The patient had no history of trauma to the head as well as no positive history of seizures.There was no significant past medical or surgical history.The patient’s addiction history was positive for heroin, Hashish, and methamphetamine both orally as well as intravenously.On examination, his vital signs on arrival were as follows: blood pressure, 110/60 mmHg (reference, 120/80 mmHg); pulse, 100 bpm (reference, 70 to 100 bpm); respiratory rate, 30 breaths/minute (reference range, 18 to 22); and temperature, 102°F (reference, 98.6°F).Furthermore, in his general physical exam, he was positive for jaundice and had marks of cuts on his forearm, suggesting the possibility of multiple needle insertions.His abdominal, respiratory, and cardiovascular exam results were unremarkable.His Glasgow coma scale (GCS) on arrival was 10/15.He had dilated pupils reactive to light, as well as a positive corneal reflex.All cranial nerves were intact; however, signs of meningeal irritation were present.A motor examination showed an increased tone in all limbs, positive rigidity in all four limbs, his patellar reflex was 3+, his plantars were down-going, and clonus (ankle and knee) was negative.Furthermore, the results of the fundoscopic examination were unremarkable.\\\\nWe immediately did clinical laboratory testing of this patient.His laboratory test results are presented in Table .Given our region, we also tested for malaria and found the patient was positive for Plasmodium falciparum.Given the patient’s intravenous drug abuse, we also tested his viral markers and HIV status, the results of which were positive for both hepatitis B and C and HIV, with a CD4 count of 270 (reference range, 500 to 1500).Immediately, the patient was catheterized with monitoring of urine output, and a nasogastric tube was passed.The patient was started on artemether, 120 mg, delivered in six doses spaced 12 hours apart, and intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g/day for five days.The patient had low random blood glucose levels of 60 mg/dL (reference range, 79 to 160 mg/dL), for which he was started on 5% dextrose saline intravenously as well.At this point, we were suspicious of many differentials such as cerebral malaria, bacterial/tuberculous/fungal meningitis, cytomegalovirus/herpes simplex virus encephalitis, drug overdose, central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, as well as toxoplasmosis.To arrive at a final diagnosis, we conducted a series of additional investigations.We ordered a chest X-ray and ultrasound of the abdomen, the findings of which were unremarkable.To rule out meningitis, we did a lumbar puncture, and his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings are presented in Table .At the time of the lumbar puncture, his random blood glucose level was 102 mg/dL (reference range, 79 to 160 mg/dL).Results of the tests were negative for Cryptococcus antigen and tuberculosis.A computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain were unremarkable, thereby ruling out ring-enhancing lesions due to tuberculoma, CNS lymphoma or toxoplasmosis.', 'An 11-year-old girl was reported to ambulatory care with fever and headache for 2 weeks.Prior to these symptoms, the patient was in normal health.She had febrile episodes (100–102 °F) without chills or rigors.The fever was associated with severe headache on the right side and was not associated with any vomiting, nausea or aura.The patient did not have any other significant complaints, clinical signs or symptoms pertaining to the ear, nose, throat or chest, or bleeding diathesis except for a history of falling 2 years previously when she was 9 years of age.\\\\nWe admitted the patient for further evaluation.On clinical examination, the patient had tenderness over the right mastoid bone with an intact tympanic membrane.With the above history, a provisional diagnosis of acute mastoiditis of the right side was made.Pediatric neurology, endocrinology, and ophthalmology consultations were obtained.On fundoscopy, the patient had bilateral papilledema with normal vision on both sides and was referred for further imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain which revealed no space-occupying lesions in the brain.\\\\nRoutine investigations were all within normal limits except for erythrocyte sedimentation rate which showed a three-fold increase in the first hour.', 'A 29-year-old male presented with progressively worsening symptoms, including altered mental status, lower extremity weakness, nausea and vomiting for 6 months, with symptomatology extending back more than 6 years prior to this decline.He also reported headaches, dizziness, multiple falls, and right facial numbness and tingling during his 6-month decline.Previously, he had had seizures that were controlled with medication.Prior to referral to neurosurgery, his presumptive diagnosis was hydrocephalus, for which he had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed.Neurological examination was significant for mild dysarthria, a non-reactive left pupil, nystagmus on primary gaze of the left eye, bilateral nystagmus on horizontal gaze and mild action tremors in both hands.\\\\nInitial pre- and post-contrast-enhanced CT scans demonstrated diffuse enhancement of the basimeninges as well as heterogeneously enhancing cystic and solid lesions in the right temporal lobe and left cerebellum.Subsequent contrast-enhanced T1 weighted MRI of the brain demonstrated extensive post-contrast nodular enhancement of the basimeninges associated with an approximately 5 × 4 cm solid and cystic mass in the right temporal lobe ().', 'A 79-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic infection of a left knee prosthesis, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease stage 3A presented to the wound care clinic after two days of subjective fever that partially improved with acetaminophen.He denied any associated symptoms.The patient had recently undergone multiple left knee revisions and received several antibiotics in an attempt to treat the draining chronic left knee infection (Table ).\\\\nHe developed severe allergic reactions (urticarial rashes and angioedema) to cephalexin and ciprofloxacin trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.Subsequently, 11 days prior to presentation, he was started on ertapenem and daptomycin.Moreover, before intravenous daptomycin and ertapenem were started, he had not received additional antibiotics for over a month.The patient had no previous history of pulmonary diseases and he denied any exposure to pulmonary irritants.Upon admission, the patient had a Hickman catheter for long-term antibiotic use without signs of acute inflammation.He had wheezing throughout the bilateral lung fields but no crackles.A draining tract with serosanguinous fluid drainage was observed on his left knee.His physical exam was otherwise unremarkable.The initial laboratory work demonstrated moderate anemia, normal white blood cells but with bandemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (Table ).\\\\nA chest x-ray showed new diffuse interstitial opacities (Figure ).A single anteroposterior portable chest X-ray was obtained on admission.Compared to a chest X-ray nine months prior, there were new diffuse branching interstitial opacities extending outward from hila associated with additional circular interstitial opacities.These were likely representing peribronchovascular interstitial thickening.There may be a trace of left pleural effusion without right pleural effusion.Additionally, the aorta was atherosclerotic and a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction was seen in situ.\\\\nOn the second day of admission, the patient started having worsening shortness of breath, desaturation, tachycardia, and persistent fever.Examination of the lungs revealed bilateral crackles while the lower limbs and the trunk showed a new reticulopapular, non-pruritic rash.Repeat complete blood count (CBC) revealed new-onset eosinophilia.A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed diffuse reticulonodular opacities in the lungs with peripheral predominance, areas of ground-glass opacities, and nodularities.Daptomycin AEP was suspected and the antibiotic was promptly discontinued and meropenem was started.Methylprednisolone and inhaled breathing treatments were ordered and the patient’s symptoms significantly improved thereafter.A repeat chest x-ray one month later showed resolution of the interstitial markings (Figure ).One month after the initial presentation, a repeat chest x-ray was obtained.The lungs appeared clear without apparent pleural effusion.No active disease in the chest was identified.', 'A previously well 87-year-old Caucasian woman living in a senior assisted care center presented to the neurology clinic with complaints of six months of slowly progressing left sided weakness.Initial difficulty in ambulating and using the stairs progressed to being wheelchair bound.Neurologic exam revealed diffuse 3/5 left sided weakness, left leg drift, and left facial droop.Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large confluent white matter T2-hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe with multifocal nodular enhancement of the left cerebral hemisphere ().', 'A 33-year-old male presented to our center with chief complaints of profuse per rectal bleed mixed with stool for three days that was associated with easy fatigability for one week prior to the initial presentation.He also had one episode of black tarry stool.However, he had no complaints of blood in vomit, purpuric rashes, or petechiae.He also had no hematuria, weight loss, night sweats, evening rise of temperature or loss of appetite, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitation, limb edema, loose stools, jaundice, and abdominal distension.Bleeding was absent from other orifices.He had no history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiac diseases, and pulmonary tuberculosis in the past.He consumed 80 grams of alcohol per day for 15 years, but he did not smoke.\\\\nOn examination, he was ill looking, conscious, and was well oriented to time place and person.He had pallor and was dehydrated.However, he had no icterus, clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.His pulse rate was 110 beats/minute, blood pressure was 80/60 mm of Hg, body temperature was 98°F (36.6°C), respiratory rate was 19 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation was 95% in room air.The digital rectal examination showed fresh blood over the examining finger and otherwise normal findings.Abdominal and cardiac examination was normal.\\\\nLaboratory investigations showed hemoglobin 10.8 g/dl and hematocrit 31.6%.The total leukocyte count was 11510/mm3, neutrophils were 78%, and platelet count was 291000/mm3.The prothrombin time was 14 seconds, and the International normalized ratio was 1.08.The albumin level in the blood was 2.4 gm/dl, and total protein was 6.1 gm/dl, total and direct bilirubin were 0.7 and 0.1 mg/dl in the blood.Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase level was 97 U/L and 114 U/L, respectively.HbA1C level in the blood was 7.2. The level of urea (33 mg/dl), creatinine (1.1 mg/dl), sodium (132 mEq/l), and potassium (3.6 mEq/l) were within normal range.Traces of sugar and albumin (++) were present in the urine examination.The fecal occult blood was found in the stool.Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not detected in sputum in the acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain.\\\\nThe chest X-ray was normal.Ultrasonography (USG) of the abdomen and pelvis and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed normal findings.A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of chest and abdomen showed asymmetric circumferential thickening in the ileocaecal

overlying exudates in terminal ileum and ascending and transverse colon.Histopathological examination of the ileum and colon showed patchy ulcers with exudates, granulation tissue, fibrosis, deep lymphoplasmocytic inflammation, and crypt regenerative changes with fibrinoid changes in scattered capillaries and venules and was inconclusive.However, gene XPERT was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\\\\nHe was diagnosed with ileocaecal tuberculosis.The hemoglobin level dropped to 6.1 g/dl after two days of admission, and he had an episode of weakness associated with profuse sweating and rigor.Fluid resuscitation followed by two pints of whole blood transfusion was performed.After that, his hemoglobin was increased to 10.2 mg/dl.He was managed with four antitubercular drugs and showed significant improvement.Following this, he was discharged on oral antitubercular medications (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and pyridoxine) after 10 days of admission.On follow-up after two weeks, he was responding well to antitubercular medications with improved symptoms, i.e., no per rectal bleeding, and his liver function test was within the normal range.', 'A

year-old woman with a history of hypothyroidism and pre-eclampsia initially presented to an outside hospital with acute onset dense left hemiplegia, right gaze preference, and left-sided neglect.Her initial National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 14 and she had an admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 10.A computed tomography (CT) angiogram of her neck revealed complete occlusion of the right cervical internal carotid artery (ICA).She was outside the time window for intravenous thrombolysis; however, she underwent mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retreiver device and aspiration (Penumbra System®, Alameda, CA).Immediately after the procedure, there was a successful restoration of the blood flow to the distal ICA, proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA), and to the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), with residual distal M2 occlusion.She was intubated for the procedure and was extubated in the following days.Her left-sided weakness persisted and a repeat CTA showed re-occlusion of the right cervical ICA.No further intervention was done and she was treated with aspirin and statin for secondary stroke prophylaxis.The stroke was deemed cryptogenic after work-up for a potential source was negative including an echocardiogram which demonstrated a normal ejection fraction, normal left atrial size, and negative bubble study.A workup for prothrombotic and hypercoagulable states were negative as well.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was done which showed a large area of diffusion restriction with corresponding decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2 hyperintensity in the right frontal, parietal, temporal lobes and in the basal ganglia with areas of hypointensities on gradient echo sequencing, which suggested infarction in

arteriovenous malformation (AVM), which was treated with embolization (July 2014).Ten months after the lesion (May 2015), she was admitted to the Ataxia Laboratory of IRCCS Fondazione Santa Lucia.A neurological examination revealed severe ataxia with a total motor score of 46/100 on the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) ().\\\\nDuring the anamnestic interview, no cognitive problems were apparent prior to the cerebellar lesion.However, episodes of inappropriate behaviours were described in childhood, although they had been underestimated by MT's parents.The patient's major complaint was the worsening of some symptoms (i.e., impulsiveness) and the onset of other behavioural abnormalities, also confirmed by the husband, and included referred hallucinations, together with a euphoric state similar to a manic mood phase.These symptoms arose after the cerebellar accident; they were already present in September 2014 (5 months after the acute event) and worsened over time.\\\\nTherefore, an assessment of her personality and mood changes was performed by an expert psychotherapist using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV Axis I Disorders (SCID I) () and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV Axis II Disorders (SCID-II) ().It should be noted that, at the time of the patient's evaluation, the Italian version of SCID I and SCID II scale related to the new DSM- 5 criteria () was not yet available.It was determined that MT suffered from borderline personality organization and bipolar I disorder, mixed episode, as already described by Lupo et al.().\\\\nMoreover, an adjustment disorder with a disturbance in conduct, from which she had been suffering since childhood, was also diagnosed.In Lupo et al.(), the authors linked these behavioural alterations to an abnormal cerebellar influence during cerebral development due to the congenital nature of the AVM ().\\\\nThe patient was never pharmacologically treated for psychiatric symptomatology.\\\\nThe patient's major psychiatric symptoms, as detected by the psychological assessment, and experienced during the manic mood phase, are listed below:\\\\n- Euphoria\\\\n-

a 45-year-old woman, a non-smoker, treated for type II diabetes under insulin and primary hyperparathyroidism.Her medical history dates back to 2006 with an infiltrated nodule associated with ulcers that grew gradually in her right thigh.The patient underwent surgery with an anatomopathological study.Skin biopsy objectified ulcerated epidermotropic dermo-hypodermal tumor proliferation whose morphological appearance and immunohistochemical data are in favor of LCH.Langerhans cells present positivity of the anti-PS100 antibody, anti-CD1a antibody, and anti-Ki67 antibody (60%), and negativity of the anti-CD68 antibody.The patient subsequently received 25 sessions of radiotherapy followed by six courses of chemotherapy with a low dose of oral methotrexate.After these treatments, skin lesions are stable.In 2020, the patient complained of an increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of several infiltrating nodules, scaling, crusted papules, and ulcerated plaques.The patient received chemotherapy as single-system LCH (SS-LCH) based on methotrexate, associated with prednisone and vinblastine, with the obtainment of stable response and limited regression of the lesions.After two courses, the patient was lost to follow-up.One year later, the oncologist referred the patient to the hematology department for a major increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of new ones on her thigh.Dermatological examination found ulcers and necrotic lesions, purplish, well-limited, of variable size, not painful, not warm to the skin, and localized to the right thigh.The mucous membranes and integuments were unharmed (Figure ).\\\\nFurthermore, the examination found an afebrile, obese patient (body mass index (BMI) at 44.8).Abdominal and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable.The physical examination did not find any tumoral syndromes, and the patient did not present have B signs (fever, weight loss, and night sweats).A complete assessment was carried out in favor of a cutaneous location without visceral involvement.A CT scan of the chest and abdomen was normal.Extensive investigation revealed no systemic involvement, central nervous system (CNS) evaluation was not done, serum thyroid hormone levels were normal, endocrine workup was performed, including cortisolemia, and parathormone assessment were done in favor of primary hyperparathyroidism.A skin biopsy was performed.The microscopic examination revealed a cutaneous tissue with an infiltrate of large cells involving the dermis and realizing an epidermotropism.The infiltrate was composed of atypical cells with abundant, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, irregular and elongated or lobed nuclei with prominent nuclear grooves and folds, fine chromatin, and indistinct nucleoli.Multinucleated giant tumor cells, high cytonuclear atypia, and marked nuclear pleomorphism were seen.The mitotic figures were increased.The neoplastic cells also showed a mixed inflammatory background with variable numbers of reactive lymphocytes, plasma cells, benign histiocytes, and eosinophils associated (Figure ).\\\\nThe immunohistochemical stains had shown a diffuse strong and heterogeneous positivity for CD1a and S100 and variable positivity for CD45.All other markers studied were negative, including CD68, cytokeratins (AE1/AE3), and melanocytic marker (MelanA).The Ki-67 proliferation index was high (50%) (Figure ).\\\\nIn the light of microscopic and phenotypic results, the diagnosis of Langerhans cell sarcoma was confirmed.The patient did not receive any maintenance therapy and she received only two courses of chemotherapy; consequently, the patient was included in the LCH protocol as single-system LCH (SS-LCH), and she received the same chemotherapy combining prednisone (60 mg / m2), high-dose of methotrexate (5000 mg/m2), and vinblastine (10 mg/m2).The evolution was favorable after five cycles of chemotherapy with significant regression of lesions in the thigh without the appearance of any new lesions (Figure ).', 'A 15-year-old female was returning for follow-up after a 1-month medroxyprogesterone acetate challenge test.The patient had been seen at the clinic prior to age 10 and returned at age 14, reporting menarche at age 14.The patient returned at age 15 and reported that menstruation had started and stopped twice.Free testosterone was high (6.8 pg/mL), and polycystic ovary syndrome was suspected.This patient history may have deterred clinicians from initially including a differential diagnosis of MRKH.The patient was given the medroxyprogesterone acetate challenge test for suspected secondary amenorrhea and returned for follow-up, after 1 month.The patient had not menstruated after the medroxyprogesterone challenge test.\\\\nIn a detailed sexual history, the patient reported being sexually active, including vaginal penetration and excluding anal penetration.At this visit, the patient reported continued amenorrhea, lower abdominal pain, and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs).\\\\nUpon attempted collection of a genital swab specimen for sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing, labia minora and majora were present, but no opening to the vagina could be identified, such that the genital swab could not penetrate beyond a wall of pale pink, thin tissue, immediately past labia minora.Further physical examination of the genital tract, or insertion of a speculum, was not possible due to this abnormality.There were no masses in the abdomen, and urethral and rectal openings were intact and fully developed.Ultrasound confirmed the lack of a vaginal canal, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a remnant uterus, consistent with a diagnosis of MRKH.', 'Patient 1: A 65-year-old male was diagnosed with AML in January 2020 with the manifestation of leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and anaemia.BM aspiration revealed a hypercellular BM with 50% blasts.Flow cytometry showed the immunophenotype of myeloid blasts.Cytogenetics revealed a complex karyotype, and a molecular panel identified aberrations in ASXL1, CEBPA, JAK2, and RUNX1.None of the 41 gene fusions were detected by using multiple RT–PCR assay ().Therefore, AML with adverse risk was diagnosed according to genetic risk stratification ().After one course of induction treatment with the IA regimen [idarubicin 12 mg/m2 day1-3, cytarabine 100 mg/m2 continuous infusion day1-7.], the patient achieved complete remission with minimal residual disease as low as 5.8x10-4 by flow cytometry analysis.Genetic analyses showed that all gene mutations were negative.Subsequently, the patient refused bone marrow transplant for financial reasons.He received one course of the IA regimen and 3 courses of the high-dose Ara-c (HiDAC) regimen [cytarabine 2 g/m2 over 3 h every 12 h on day1–3.] as consolidation therapies.However, the remission duration only lasted for 11 months.In November 2020, relapsed BM morphology was detected, with 17.5% blasts concurrent with molecular aberration recurrence.Therefore, relapsed AML was diagnosed.Initially, venetoclax combined with azacitidine [VA, venetoclax once daily (100 mg day1, 200 mg day2, 400 mg day3-28) and azacitidine 75 mg/m2 day1-7.] was administered as a salvage therapy, an effective regimen recommended for the treatment of R/R AML patients who are ineligible for intensive salvage chemotherapy, but progressive disease was observed.Then, his treatment plan switched to a chidamide combined with venetoclax plus azacitidine regimen [chidamide 5 mg daily day1-7, venetoclax 100 mg day1, 200 mg day2, 400 mg day3-21; azacitidine 75 mg/m2 daily day1-7.], and CR was achieved after one course of therapy.The patient treatment process is shown in .After 3 months of follow-up, unfortunately, the patient gave up further treatment and passed away due to disease progression.The overall survival time was 1.5 years from first diagnosis.', 'The patient is a 69-year-old woman who presented to her primary care physician with worsening cough and pain wrapping around her chest to her back.The chest pain was initially thought to be pleuritic in nature and related to an exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).When there was no improvement in her symptoms with treatment of her COPD, and considering the confounding radicular distribution of her pain, a plan was made to have an MRI of the spine performed to explore other possible etiologies of her pain.\\\\nPrior to the scheduled MRI, the patient was seen in the emergency department and diagnosed with a myocardial infarction due to hypertensive emergency.', 'The second case was that of a 93-year-old woman.Her diagnosis at admission included a gallstone, acute attack of chronic cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.The surgeons performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to relieve the biliary obstruction.The growth of Escherichia coli (ESBL +) and Enterococcus faecium was observed in bile bacterial culture during ultrasound-guided cholecystostomy.Blood cultures were positive for Escherichia coli (ESBL +).Mechanical ventilation and CVVH were performed at admission.The initial antibiotic treatment regimen comprised 500 mg imipenem/cilastatin q12 h ivgtt and 1,250 mg vancomycin ivgtt.Starting on D2, the patient was administered 750 mg vancomycin QD ivgtt.On D5, the patient was treated with CVVH again because of oliguria and elevated creatinine.On D7, blood culture tests were negative, thus imipenem/cilastatin was switched to piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin was continued.On D14, the drainage fluid culture was negative and the patient was transferred to the general surgery department for further treatment.On D21, antimicrobial treatment was discontinued.', 'Case 2: The second patient was an 89-year-old male individual with a history of hypertension and delirium.Before surgery, his blood pressure was well controlled, and although he was taking dementia medicine, the patient was able to follow commands well.His pulmonary function test results indicated an obstructive pattern.Total hip arthroplasty was performed using the same anesthetic regimen used for the first patient.While ventilating at an FiO2 of 0.4, the patient showed an onset of hypoxia, with O2 saturation level dropping from 100% to 80% and PaO2 dropping from 129 to 53.0. This patient also showed an improvement of O2 saturation level from 81% to 88% after recovering spontaneous respiration by administering a muscle relaxant-reversing agent.His O2 saturation level improved to 90% with continuous positive airway pressure.Similar to the first patient, the second patient’s O2 saturation level improved to 98% after surgery.\\\\nNeither patient developed any respiratory complications after surgery.The first patient had no notable findings on the postoperative chest X-ray, whereas the second patient showed subsegmental atelectasis on the right middle lobe compared with the preoperative findings ().', 'A 33-year-old woman, with severe postburn mentosternal contracture and cicatricial carcinoma, presented for skin grafting surgery in our hospital.The burn occurred when she was 4-year-old.She underwent two reconstructive procedures at 7 and 14 years in local medical centers.Due to the pain caused by the occurrence of cicatricial carcinoma, affecting eating and speaking, she had tried several medical centers for treatment in the past year, but failed for unsuccessful ATI.In preoperative physical examination, severe scar contractures and large tumor of approximately 15 × 12 cm were observed on the lower lip, neck, and anterior chest (Figure ); the chin, chest, and bilateral armpits fused together; the cervicomental and mentosternal angles completely obliterated; the anterior neck structures, including the larynx, the trachea, and the carotid arteries, were unidentifiable or impalpable.Mouth opening was limited (15 mm) and Mallampati test could not be performed.The left nostril was obstructive for stenosis, but the right nostril breathing was smooth.Preoperative X-rays and a computed tomography scan (data not shown) revealed distortion of the upper airway and no stenosis of the trachea.It was difficult to perform face mask ventilation because of the nearly fixed neck and regressed mandible.\\\\nAccording to the guidelines on the management of difficult airway, awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation with topicalization is preferred in such patients, but the patient rejected ATI for discomfort and nociceptive recall before.Meanwhile, other awake strategies, including lightwand, GlideScopeⓇ Video laryngoscope, laryngeal mask airway, oral or nasal blind intubation, retrograde intubation, surgical tracheostomy, seem impossible.Therefore, a flexible bronchoscopic intubation protocol under precise sedation, topicalization, and spontaneous respiration preservation seems a promising strategy, but the airway should be secured for there was no definite backup plan.\\\\nA written informed consent was taken with explanation focused on the risks of difficult airway.Atropine 0.5 mg was intramuscular injected to reduce secretion 30 min before transferring to the operating room.The patient was monitored by respiration rate, ventilation volume, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, blood pressure and bispectral index (BIS), and preoxygenated once she arrived in the operation room.Vital signs were stable.A pillow and some folded sheets were stuffed between the patient back and the operating bed to make her feel comfortable.Intravenous midazolam 2 mg and sufentanil 5 μg were given.Nasal passage was anesthetized by pledgets with 2% lidocaine and 0.25% phenylephrine.Sevoflurane 2% with a flow rate of 4 L/min with 100% O2 was administered via an endoscopic mask connected to the ventilator circuit.The concentration of sevoflurane was gradually increased to 4% and stopped when the BIS reached 55–60 within 3 min, then airway reassessment and precise topicalization were achieved by a modified SAYGO technique., , An epidural catheter (Figure ), with an outer diameter of 3.8 mm, was fixed and 1.5 cm longer was applied at the end of the fiberscope (MDH A10; Zhuhai Mindhao Medical Technology Co., Ltd., ShenZhen, China).Topicalization was achieved by spraying 2% lidocaine (7 ml) via the catheter onto the posterior nasal canal, pharyngeal cavity, epiglottis, glottis, and tracheal (Figure ).Meanwhile, supplemental oxygen 10 L/min was delivered by a hose (Figure ) through the mouth to avoid hypoxemia.When lidocaine worked, about 5 minutes later, sevoflurane was inhaled again until the BIS reached 55–60.Then, a Parker Flex-Tip® tube with an inner diameter of 6.0 mm (Lead Medical Instrument Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China), which was heated by 40 ℃ and lubricated in advance, was successfully and smoothly inserted into the trachea from the direction of flexible bronchoscopy (Figure ).No stress reactions, including cough, hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypoxia, and bronchospasm, and no intubation related complications, such as airway trauma, airway obstruction, and bleeding, were occurred during intubation.Finally, the patient was very satisfied with this experience after emergence.', 'This 60-year-old male was hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19 with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea.We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward.First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea.To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step.In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes.This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%.Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation.Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution.In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation.Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity.However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation.Exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.', 'A 74-year old, right-handed female presented with anxiety and depressive symptoms to the psychiatric ED at the University Hospital of Geneva (HUG, Switzerland) in 2012, after SA by abuse of acetaminophen.Although showing depressive symptoms, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed., DSM-V) [], the latter could not be classified as a major episode of depression (MDD).She had suffered a circumscribed ischemic stroke two years earlier, which had left her with incomplete Broca’s aphasia and dysprosody.By “incomplete” we mean two things here: (i) the fact that the severity of the speech impairment fluctuated over time, leaving the patient with better abilities on some days and worse on others, and (ii) the fact that the patient always retained some capability to express very simple words and phrases.However, due to the patient’s refusal to undergo testing with psychometric scales, we were unable to assess the severity of this deficit through the use of more objective means, such as battery scores.\\\\nThe examining physicians, becoming aware of the specific symptoms, retrospectively examined her file (after the consent of the patient and later of her husband), which contained all the clinical, laboratory, and imaging elements that had been collected.\\\\nThe patient had no family or personal history of psychiatric diseases, nor SI/SB, prior to the onset of her language impairments.Her only other somatic complaint was hypertension.Her family was very supportive and consisted of a husband, three children, and several grand-children.The patient was bilingual in Italian and French and had been working as a writer and translator.\\\\nAfter hospitalization in a psychiatric unit, a cerebral MRI was performed, revealing a diffuse white matter high-signal hyper-intensity in the left posteroinferior portion of the frontal lobe, just anterior to motor cortex.', 'A 3-year old girl presented with swelling over the root of the nose.Her parents had noticed swelling 7 months previously, which was gradually progressive and was the size of a small lemon at the time of presentation.The swelling was not associated with fever, nasal obstruction, bleeding or any other nasal complaints.The patient was prescribed antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs by the general practitioner, following which the swelling decreased slightly.The patient had recurrent episodes in which the swelling increased in size.The size of the swelling decreased on medication, but never completed resolved.There was no history of tubercular contact or any other family history of tuberculosis.On examination, the root of the nose was broadened by the ill-defined 2.5×2.0 cm swelling, but the overlying skin was normal ().\\\\nOn palpation, the swelling was soft and non-tender with a normal temperature.Anterior rhinoscopy revealed no abnormality.Blood analysis showed raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 38mm).The patient had a positive Monteux test, and a chest X- ray showed no abnormality.Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the nose revealed an enhancing soft tissue mass lesion in the superior aspect of both of the nasal cavities, measuring 2.0 ×1.8 × 2.8 cm (AP × TR × CC), eroding the intervening nasal septum, frontal and nasal bones at the glabella and reaching to the subcutaneous tissue ().\\\\nThe base of the skull was eroded with a small intracranial extension.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and paranasal sinus revealed enhancing soft tissue mass in the basifrontal extra-axial region with dural enhancement extending inferiorly into the superior parts of the nasal cavities with osseous destruction ().\\\\nThe patient underwent endoscopic examination and biopsy under general anesthesia.', 'A 57-year-old female patient presented with IC VS on the right side with profound hearing loss after SRS.At the age of 4, she had mumps resulting in a profound sensorineural hearing loss on the left side.An earlier CI evaluation revealed a negative promontory test on the left side.In 2010, she developed hearing loss on the right side, and IC VS was detected using cMRI.', 'A 34-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with complaints of right hemiparesis, numbness, dysphagia, and ataxia.These complaints began as numbness over her right scapular area two weeks prior, and the numbness later progressed to include the right leg.Additionally, she reported five days of waking up during the night with severe headaches.Although she reported a history of migraines, which were usually accompanied by an aura, she stated that these new headaches were different in nature.She also had no known allergies and no previous surgeries.Her mother had a history of breast cancer, and her father had a history of ischemic heart disease.A review of systems was otherwise negative.After workup in the emergency department and consultation by neurology, she was referred to neurosurgery for management of a high-grade brainstem tumor.\\\\nExamination\\\\nOn initial presentation, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15.Her pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact.Motor testing revealed that strength was 5/5 in both upper and lower extremities.Pronator drift was noted in the right upper extremity.Dysmetria was noted in the right upper extremity during finger-to-nose testing, and discrimination of fine touch was subjectively diminished on the entire right side from the zygomatic process to the foot.Patellar reflexes were 3+ bilaterally.Over the course of her initial admission, the patient demonstrated a progressive decline, to include mild left facial droop, dysarthria, and a worsening dysphagia.A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed because the patient was unable to swallow without effort.These findings continued until her initial discharge.Upon readmission, the patient displayed similar findings.Left lower quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the shoulder and acute numbness of the left chest and shoulder were also noted.These findings progressed and worsened until the patient was intubated after deteriorating to a GCS score of 10.\\\\nImaging\\\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast revealed a heterogeneous T1 hypointense (Figure ) and T2 hyperintense (Figure ) signal abnormality involving the pontine base and extending into the medulla.', 'A 27-year-old G1P0 pregnant woman, whose results of non-invasive prenatal gene detection at 21+2 weeks of gestation, suggested that the risk of trisomy 18 (– 6.6) was high, while the risk of trisomy 21 (0.681) and trisomy 13 (2.363) was low.Ultrasound examination at 23+2 weeks of gestation revealed a single live fetus with a gestational age of 23+2 weeks in utero, whereas the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck of the fetus for 1 week.The measurement indexes of fetal development are as follows: biparietal diameter = 6.0 cm, head circumference = 20.9 cm, abdominal circumference = 17.4 cm, femur long = 4.0 cm, amniotic fluid index = 16.7 cm, and the 3 values of umbilical artery S/D were 4.6, 3.2, and 2.7 respectively.It is suggested that amniocentesis, chromosome karyotype analysis, and CNVs should be recommended to further confirm the condition of the fetal chromosome.\\\\nChromosome karyotype analysis after amniocentesis showed that the fetal chromosome karyotype was 46, XY, del (18) (q22.3; q23) (Fig.A).CNV detection results showed that this sample detected chromosome aneuploidy or CNVs of more than 100 kb, which was regarded as the definite pathogenic genomic: 18q22.3q23 (68900001-76560000), and the size of the deleted fragment was 7.66 Mb (Fig.B, C).', 'A 49-year-old trans man who had been on testosterone therapy for 10 years presented to the emergency department with central chest pain.His high-sensitivity cardiac troponin was 24 ng/L (female reference range\\u2005<16 ng/L, male reference range\\u2005<26 ng/L).How should he be managed?\\\\nCardiac troponin is released from damaged cardiomyocytes and is one of the most common biomarkers used in the prediction of myocardial infarction.There is considerable debate regarding the use of sex-specific reference ranges for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), as there is uncertainty whether the use of sex-specific reference limits impact upon clinical management or outcome prediction ().However, as upper reference limits based on sex-specific 99th percentiles for hs-cTn are subtly higher for people recorded as males than those recorded females in population studies (), use of sex-specific cutoffs for hs-cTn assays have been endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine ().The difference has been attributed to people presumed male at birth having a larger cardiac mass as well as subclinical coronary artery disease ().No studies have been performed to examine cardiac mass changes that may occur with masculinizing hormone therapy in people presumed female at birth.There are however data in polycystic ovary syndrome in which high testosterone concentrations are a clinical feature (albeit far lower than testosterone concentrations seen in transgender men).Polycystic ovary syndrome has been associated with higher left ventricular mass index and larger left atrial diameter over 5 years of follow-up, even after adjustment for blood pressure, body mass index, glucose, and lipids ().Large population-based studies have also shown that left ventricular mass correlates with body weight, lean body mass, and fat mass ().There is currently insufficient data to draw an inference regarding the appropriate reference range in people using gender-affirming hormone therapy, and emphasis must be placed on clinical history, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and serial trajectory of hs-cTn levels if the hs-cTn falls in between the male and female-specific reference ranges.\\\\nDespite the fact that Case 4 had been on established testosterone therapy for 10 years with resultant male body composition, there is insufficient data to suggest that cardiac remodeling or change in cardiac size occurs\\\\nwith high (or low) testosterone concentrations.Despite the risk of being oversensitive, in order to minimize the risk of missing an acute coronary event, we suggest that the reference range of the sex presumed at birth (female) should be used to interpret hs-cTn, provided the patient is informed of this rationale in addition to monitoring with serial troponin to ensure there is no rise.Case 3’s subsequent hs-cTn was elevated above the male reference range and his ECG revealed anterior ST-segment depression consistent with acute coronary syndrome.', \"A 57-year-old Thai man from Sa Kaeo, a province in the Eastern region of Thailand referred to a University Teaching Hospital in Bangkok due to swelling and pain at the left side of the neck for one month.One week prior he was admitted to the local hospital due to low-grade fever, difficulty swallowing and hoarseness.He received intravenous ceftriaxone and clindamycin for presumptive diagnosis of deep neck infection.He had history of hypertension treated with amlodipine 10 mg and enalapril 10 mg daily.He had habits of heavy alcohol drinking for 40 years, and smoking.He works at the department of fisheries.He swam, cleaned fish pond and mowed the lawn.Upon admission (day 0), the patient's body weight was 52 kg, body mass index was 19.7\\u202fkg/m2.His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 38.7\\u202f°C; blood pressure, 170/100\\u202fmmHg, pulse rate, 100 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min.On physical examination, mild pale conjuctivae, anicteric sclerae.The neck exam revealed pulsatile left neck mass size 5\\u202f×\\u202f5\\u202fcm in diameters, mild tender on palpation, no sign of inflammation.No limitation of neck movement.Oropharyngeal exam revealed bulging of left posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsil enlargement causing the narrowing of upper airway.Thyroid gland was not enlarged.Other exams included neurological exam were normal.Skin exam revealed multiple ill-defined scaly mild erythematous patches on both legs and dystrophic nails.Initial laboratory results showed anemia with hemoglobin concentration of 9.6\\u202fg/L and Hematocrit of 28%, MCV of 75 fl, white blood cell count of 6800 cells/mm3 with 80% neutrophil 7.7% lymphocytes, platelet count of 574,000 cells/mm3.Hemoglobin typing was normal (HbF 0.2% HbA2 2.9% HbA 85.9%; HbA2A).Liver function test showed AST

1.05 mg/dL, Anti-HIV test was negative.Viral hepatitis profile were negative.His chest X-ray was normal.He was diagnosed with anemia of chronic disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and xerotic eczema.Computer tomography of the neck showed a concealed ruptured of left external carotid artery 0.9\\u202f×\\u202f1.9\\u202fcm in size with surrounding hematoma (3.6\\u202f×\\u202f3.6\\u202f×5.8\\u202fcm) at medial aspect of an aneurysm resulted in narrowing of the upper airway (A, B).Urgent surgical exploration on day 0 revealed severe adhesion around pseudoaneurysm (size 5\\u202f×\\u202f6\\u202fcm) confined around common carotid artery, carotid bifurcation, extended to the angle of mandible.The diameter of pseudoaneurysm neck was one cm, located at medial wall of common carotid artery just distal to carotid bifurcation.External carotid artery was obliterated.Angiogram and balloon occlusion was performed at the left common carotid artery.External carotid artery and internal carotid artery were ligated at the arterial stump just beneath the angle of mandible.Pseudoaneurysm was resected and internal content show pus and clot.Surgical margins were not free in gross section.The pus was sent for bacterial culture.Blood agar plate revealed rare growth of whitish colony, direct exam from the colony revealed broad rare septate fungal hyphae.Infectious disease was consulted on day 5 of admission.Serum antibodies to pythium antigen using an in-house rapid immunochromatographic test were positive on day 5.Sabouraud's glucose agar (SGA) grew fungal colony which identified as P.insidiosum by the induction of motile zoospore and confirmed by fungal broad-range 18S rDNA gene polymerase chain reaction.Pathology of carotid artery revealed acute suppurative inflammation () with branching broad rare septate hyphae demonstrated by Gomori Methanamine Silver stain and Periodic acid-Shiff stain (A) Immunohistochemistry stain for P.insidiosum was positive (B).Medical therapy with oral itraconazole 200 mg oral twice daily combined with terbinafine 250 mg oral twice daily were started on day

atherosclerotic change without aneurysm or dissection.Postoperatively, physical exams revealed narrowing of upper airway, hypoglossal nerve palsy on the left side without motor deficit.Neurology was consulted on day 6.He was diagnosed with hypoglossal nerve palsy secondary to compression of carotid artery aneurysm.On Day 6, MRI and MRA of the brain revealed pseudoaneurysm of carotid artery at left carotid-parapharyngeal spaces (2.8\\u202f×\\u202f2.0\\u202f×\\u202f3.1\\u202fcm) associated with extensive inflammation of the surrounding soft tissue resulting in mild narrowing of upper

primary care physician concerned about polycythemia.Their hemoglobin is 168 g/L with hematocrit 0.49, which has been flagged in the laboratory report as high (reported with female reference range of 115-155g/L and 0.33-0.45 relative to the male reference interval of 120-170g/L and 0.36-0.50).\\\\nAndrogens are known to stimulate erythropoiesis while the impact of estrogens are not as well understood.In trans people who have been on established and full-dose feminizing hormone therapy (estradiol and anti-androgen) for at least 6 months, there is a significant decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count to the female reference range (, ).Conversely after 6 months of masculinizing testosterone therapy, trans people demonstrate an increase in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count to the male reference range (, , , ).Serum hematocrit in the range of the affirmed gender is evident from 3 months after commencing gender-affirming hormone therapy ().Of note, there are association studies suggesting higher hematocrit is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (, ).This is probably a consideration for people using masculinizing hormone therapy, more so than those using feminizing hormone therapy.As smoking may additionally increase hematocrit, smoking cessation should be emphasized in those with elevated hematocrit.While the long-term cardiovascular implications of using a different reference range for hemoglobin or hematocrit are unclear in general, reference ranges of the affirmed gender should be used.Female reference ranges should be used for someone taking gender-affirming feminizing hormone therapy and male reference ranges should be used for people using masculinizing hormone therapy.\\\\nIn trans women, there is a small statistically significant but clinically insignificant rise in platelet count (which remains within the normal reference range) shown in several cohort studies after 6 to 12 months of feminizing hormone treatment (, ), while white blood cells do not change significantly.No apparent changes are observed in either platelet count or white blood cells with masculinizing hormone therapy (, ).\\\\nCase 1 outlines a nonbinary individual presumed female at birth receiving full-dose masculinizing hormone therapy.In this case, the male reference range for hemoglobin and hematocrit would be most appropriate and this should be shared with the nonbinary individual so they are aware and can expect to be misgendered when reviewing their own results.As such, their hemoglobin of 168 g/L and hematocrit of 0.49 would fall within the expected reference range and no change in management needs to occur.\\\\nReference ranges for serum ferritin, a common indicator of body iron status, vary depending on age and sex ().Ferritin reference ranges are typically lowest in premenopausal people presumed female at birth, followed by postmenopausal people and are highest in people presumed male at birth, with lower limits of the female reference range approximately 10 to 20 ug/L below that of the male reference range (30 ug/L) ().This may be partially attributed to increased iron utilization in menstruating individuals resulting in lower ferritin, as well as a multitude of factors that have been shown to impact upon adult serum ferritin levels including age, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, and liver function (, ).Animal studies suggest that iron is distributed differently in males and females associated with differences in hepatic hepcidin expression rather than sex-steroid concentrations (, ).No studies have evaluated whether ferritin or other iron indicators change with gender-affirming hormone therapy.\\\\nFrom a practical perspective, the main reason to evaluate for iron deficiency is anemia.In individuals who have a ferritin below the “male” reference range, we suggest interpreting the iron studies in the context of red cell indices such as mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration to guide management rather than on the use of gender-affirming hormone therapy.If the trans individual is menstruating or pregnant, it would be most practical to use the premenopausal female reference range for interpretation of iron studies.\\\\nFor evaluation of possible iron overload, in situations of borderline results which fall between the female and male reference ranges, relying on the absolute ferritin level or transferrin saturation will be difficult.It is pertinent to assess for concurrent inflammatory disease, liver disease, or iron overload states, such as hemochromatosis, which may further guide clinical management.', 'A 39-year-old Caucasian female was diagnosed with nodular melanoma of the right upper back following a biopsy.Wide local excision (WLE) and right axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy were performed; although WLE was negative, SLN was positive for multiple foci of residual melanoma in two LN.Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) was negative for any involvement of 19 LN.She was staged with IIIA (T3aN2aMx) disease and offered adjuvant therapy with ipilimumab based on the EORTC 18071 data [].Between January 4, 2017 and February 24, 2017, she received 3 doses of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg IV.Prior to fourth induction dose of ipilimumab, she developed flu-like symptoms and persistent headaches although no neurologic deficits were noted.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine showed mild pituitary enlargement and leptomeningeal enhancement with a nodular focus of enhancement in the right internal auditory canal (Fig.', 'A 35-year-old gentleman came to our institution in February 2021 for evaluation of persistent fever and non-resolving pneumonia.He had a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in October 2020, with classical radiological findings.He was managed conservatively under home quarantine.Two weeks later (November 2020), he had a recurrence of high spiking fever.Imaging revealed a left-sided lung consolidation.He was treated for probable pneumonia with oral amoxicillin-clavulanate.At 1-month follow-up (December 2020), there was an inadequate clinical improvement with an increase in the size of the consolidation (Figure ).Bronchoscopy was done, and bronchoalveolar lavage grew Streptococcus pneumoniae.He received another course of linezolid antibiotic.\\\\nIn 2017, he had probable vaccine-related/autoimmune optic neuritis for which he received 13 doses of rituximab between January 2017 and May 2019 (600 mg per dose).He had developed rituximab-induced hypogammaglobulinaemia in 2019.Since then, he has had persistent B-cell depletion and low immunoglobulin levels (Table ).The absolute B-cell count was zero.\\\\nDuring our evaluation, SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was negative (February 2021 and March 2021).Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) and spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) tested on the Roche Elecsys platform were undetectable in February 2021.We considered the following differentials: tuberculosis (TB), organizing pneumonia, lymphoma, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) associated vasculitis and lung malignancy.Sputum Xpert-TB-PCR was negative.Multiple blood cultures, bone marrow biopsy and culture reports for routine bacteria, Mycobacterium and fungal organisms were negative.A bronchoscopic transbronchial lung biopsy was done.Histopathology was suggestive of organizing pneumonia.Past COVID-19 infection was considered as the likely cause for organizing pneumonia.He was started on high-dose steroids, with which he improved.\\\\nHe was readmitted in April 2021 with a persistent fever.Since the patient was on high-dose steroids, the fever was attributed to a probable secondary infection or organizing pneumonia itself.Sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an antibiotic, piperacillin, was commenced.Computed tomography thorax showed resolution of the previously seen left lower lobe consolidation but had new-onset bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (Figure ).Nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive (Cepheid assay, April 2021), with a Ct value of Envelope gene (E gene) 23.2 and nucleoprotein gene (N) 24.1. A diagnosis of COVID-19 re-infection was made.He received remdesivir injection and other symptomatic medications.He became afebrile within 2 days and was discharged from the hospital.During routine follow-up in June 2021, he was asymptomatic and was now positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (anti-N: 9.6 and anti-S-RBD: 41.4) (Table ).', 'A 48-year-old, previously healthy male was admitted to the hospital with altered mental status of one day duration.The patient was confused and was not answering questions appropriately.Vital signs were remarkable for low-grade fever of 100.7 ºF and tachycardia.His physical exam was remarkable for a holosystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the axilla.He was alert and oriented to self, but not to place or time.Cranial nerves were grossly intact with no focal neurological deficits.Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis and mild hyponatremia.A computed tomography scan of the head did not show any acute intracranial hemorrhage.A lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not suggest meningitis; however, the patient was started empirically on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone.Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed large area of infarction in the left frontal, left parietal, and left caudate body, suggestive of a cardio-embolic source (Figure ).An echocardiogram revealed a large, mobile, vegetation (1.5 x 1.5 cm) on the mitral valve likely affecting the anterior and posterior leaflets with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (Figures -).Blood cultures were sent to the lab, which later grew Streptococcus agalactiae.An infectious disease team was consulted and antibiotics were switched to penicillin G and gentamicin.\\\\nA cardiothoracic surgery team was consulted and he was not deemed a surgical candidate as it was thought it would be unlikely that the patient will have a meaningful recovery, and the risks outweighed the benefits of surgery.The patient’s mental status remained the same; he remained alert and oriented to self only despite several days of antibiotics.His repeat blood cultures remained negative.\\\\nIn the third week of his hospitalization, the patient experienced worsening of his altered mental status and he was not responding to questions.An MRI of the brain showed hemorrhagic transformation of embolic infarcts with moderate cerebral edema and midline shift.', 'An 11-year-old male came to our observation for his first dental visit.His medical history was negative.No symptoms were reported by the patient or his parents.The face was symmetric and no swelling of the cervical lymph nodes was observed.Intraorally, the dentition of the permanent teeth was completed, except for the third mandibular molars and the second and third maxillary molars.Bucco-lingual expansion of the jaw bones was not evident.An orthopantomogram was performed to assess the development of third molars [].Unexpectedly, the analysis revealed an intraosseous doughnut-like lesion radiopaque at the periphery and radiolucent in the center associated with the left mandibular third molar germ (a).Additional dental abnormalities were not observed.The maximum diameter of the lesion was 5.7 mm.Based on these findings, developmental abnormalities of the third molar (e.g., dilated odontoma) and odontogenic (e.g., cementoblastoma) and non-odontogenic (e.g., osteoblastoma or osteoid osteoma) tumors were considered for differential diagnoses.To better characterize the lesion, a computed tomography (CT) scan was required.The analysis established bone integrity around the lesion and its independence from the local neuro-vascular structures.In addition, it revealed, on the sagittal projection, a small gap in the proximity of the buccal surface of the mandible (b).As the most significant clinical concern related to this condition is the risk of developing pulpal necrosis, it was decided to extract the germ of the third molar and the underlying lesion.To do this, under local anesthesia, a mucoperiosteal flap was raised posterior to the mandibular right second molar.The vestibular cortical plate was removed, exposing the ovoid mass, which was removed with the germ of the mandibular tooth.The surgical flap was repositioned and sutured.Healing was uneventful.The excised lesion appeared as an empty hard spherical mass virtually devoid of content ().It was routinely processed for paraffin embedding after fixation and decalcification.Histologically (a,b), the outer hard tissue was dentin.The inner part of dentin was in continuity with basophil calcified material, which in turn was focally in contact with the bone-like matrix.The basophil calcified material focally presented a rod-like structure consistent with enamel (b, insert).More centrally, the lesion was composed of fibro-vascular tissue.The pathologic findings were considered as consistent with a dilated odontoma.', 'We present the case of a 74-year-old man who presented with a sudden onset of painless horizontal diplopia worse with a left-directed gaze.The double vision was aborted by occluding either eye.With eye-straining, he developed a dull bitemporal headache.He denied any vision loss, dysarthria, dysphagia, chewing difficulty, neck weakness, or breathing difficulty.A visit to the ophthalmologist confirmed a normal ocular funduscopic examination and left sixth nerve palsy.His condition remained static until he presented to the neurology clinic one month later.\\\\nPast medical history was significant for bilateral below-knee amputations due to peripheral vascular disease secondary to smoking, which he quit many years ago.Otherwise, he was in relatively good health.He denied the use of any medications including antiplatelet therapy, cilostazol, statins, or anti-hypertensives.He also denied any constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, myalgias, muscle wasting, fevers, or joint pains.\\\\nOn examination, the patient appeared alert, oriented, well-nourished, and in no apparent distress.Blood pressure was recorded at 134/80 mmHg, a pulse at 64 beats per minute, and respiratory rate at 12 per minute.The patient refused to be weighed.His speech was of normal tone, volume, and prosody without any hint of dysarthria or fatigability.Cranial nerve examination revealed no facial weakness with symmetric smile, intact whistling, and no difficulty blowing his cheeks.There was an obvious left lateral rectus paresis upon assuming left gaze (Figure ).\\\\nVertical gaze was unaffected, and the pupils were spared.Masseter, genioglossus, and pterygoid function were preserved with intact jaw closure, deviation, and opening.The gag reflex was brisk.Neck flexion and extension showed adequate movement against resistance.Power in the arms was graded at 5/5 in all muscle groups with the medical research council (MRC) grading scale.Bilateral below-knee-amputation was noted, with preservation of bilateral hip flexion, adduction, and abduction.Deep tendon reflexes in the upper extremities were preserved with normal finger-to-nose coordination.\\\\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without gadolinium enhancement revealed no lesion of the brainstem or cavernous sinus, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed no cavernous sinus aneurysm.', 'A 36-year-old Caucasian female, 16 weeks into her pregnancy, presented with intractable nausea, non-bloody emesis, and poor oral intake for the prior two months.She initially presented to an outside facility for an evaluation of loss of consciousness (LOC) and mild abdominal pain.The LOC was found to be secondary to syncopal episode.The initial blood workup was significant for leukocytosis (11.54L), hyponatremia (130 mmol /L), and hypokalemia (2.5 mmol /L).Her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 496 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 1280 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 76 U/L.Lipase levels were also elevated to 83 U/L.Urine analysis was significant for ketonuria.The patient was transferred to our tertiary care facility for the management of electrolyte imbalance and acute pancreatitis with a presumed diagnosis of HG.She had an ultrasound (US) of the abdomen, which revealed mild hepatic steatosis.The patient was treated symptomatically with antiemetics, pain medications, and intravenous (IV) fluids.She had poor oral intake during the hospital stay, and her blood sugar was in the range of 50-70 mg/dL.She was started with intravenous (IV) dextrose to treat her hypoglycemia.Within 48 hours after starting IV dextrose, she developed confusion and started having problems with learned memories.She also complained of blurry vision and horizontal double vision that was worse when she turned her head toward the right side.She also had a subjective sensation of constant somersaulting and reported well-formed visual hallucinations.Her physical examination showed spontaneous upbeat nystagmus (Video ), gait instability, and ataxia with a tendency to lean to the left side while walking.\\\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, as shown in Figure , revealed symmetrical T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense signals on bilateral medial thalamic regions, more pronounced on the left along with a diffusion restriction in the same regions.', 'A 76-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension presented to the emergency department with persistent forehead swelling two months after recovering from COVID-19 infection.The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia in Egypt and completed a six-week course of dexamethasone.Per family, she also received multiple antibiotics during this time, the names and courses of which were unknown.She subsequently developed progressively tender frontal scalp swelling.Initial evaluation with otorhinolaryngology (ENT) in Egypt showed mucor-like organisms on pathology.She then came to the United States and was admitted for further evaluation.Her CT head showed evidence of multifocal sinusitis with breach of the inner and outer tables of the right frontal sinus with dural enhancement (Figure ).The CT scan also confirmed dehiscence of the inner table (Figure ).She was then empirically started on a course of Amphotericin for post-COVID mucormycosis.The patient underwent surgical debridement of significant underlying purulence with intraoperative cultures growing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.Due to these culture results, the patient was initiated on vancomycin and meropenem with minimal improvement in edema.She underwent repeat surgical debridement two weeks later with cultures redemonstrating previously identified bacteria with rare Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth as well.The patient endorsed moderate improvement in frontal scalp tenderness following this debridement.She was thus discharged home on a six-week course of IV vancomycin through a peripherally inserted central catheter, PO levofloxacin, and PO posaconazole, with a plan to continue the latter until fungal cultures were finalized.Two weeks later, she presented to the outpatient clinic with new-onset generalized weakness.Initial workup revealed profound hypokalemia (potassium of 1.5 mEq/L; normal range 3.4-5.3 mEq/L) and acute kidney injury (creatinine of 3.03 mg/dL from baseline of 1.20 mg/dL; normal range 0.65-1.00 mg/dL) likely due to vancomycin-related renal derangements and potassium wasting due to posaconazole.The patient was admitted for fluid resuscitation and switched from vancomycin to daptomycin upon discharge to prevent further renal impairment.As all her fungal cultures were negative and no fungal forms were seen on pathology, posaconazole was discontinued.The patient was able to complete her course of treatment, though it was complicated by mild creatine kinase elevation due to daptomycin.\\\\nRepeat MRI at the end of her antibiotic course demonstrated decreased soft tissue thickening along the anterior skull base and superior nasal cavity with improvement in mucosal thickening involving maxillary sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, and residual ethmoid air cells (Figure ).', 'A 31-year-old gravida 4 para 0 African American woman at 22-weeks gestation presented with vaginal bleeding to an outside hospital.Her obstetric history was significant for 2 therapeutic abortions and 1 spontaneous abortion.During prenatal care, the fetus was noted to have a unilateral dysplastic kidney.The patient’s family history was significant for two family members with cervical cancer and two family members with endometrial cancer.She was placed on bedrest with inpatient admission.48 h after admission she developed pelvic pain and uterine contractions.She expelled a mass vaginally measuring 11 × 9 × 5 cm with no fetal contents.The pathology from the outside facility showed a showed a highly cellular tumor composed of spindle-shaped cells and bizarre multinucleated giant cells with focal myxomatous change with mitotic count is greater than 50 per 10 high power field (Positive for CD10, SMA, ER, PR, EMA) with the differential diagnosis including endometrial stromal sarcoma and undifferentiated uterine sarcoma.The patient underwent examination under anesthesia, demonstrating a 3 × 3 cm defect of the posterior vaginal wall with active bleeding, which was sutured for hemostasis.The cervix was long, closed, and high with no evidence of bleeding and the fetus was intact with normal heart tones.She was discharged in stable condition.\\\\nAt 27-weeks, the patient was referred to our institution for maternal-fetal medicine, and gynecology oncology consultation.On initial evaluation, she reported no prior abnormal gynecology history and no history of infertility issues.She denied dyspareunia and bulk symptoms prior to or during pregnancy, and her periods before pregnancy were normal.A pap smear at 27-weeks gestation was normal and negative for human papilloma virus.Her intake physical exam at our institution revealed a normal pelvic exam with no evidence of residual vaginal mass, and an ultrasound revealed no intrauterine myomas.\\\\nGiven the differential diagnosis included an endometrial stromal sarcoma, an undifferentiated uterine sarcoma, and a primary vaginal sarcoma, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at 27 weeks.', 'A 74-year-old man, ASA physical class III (163 cm, 73 kg, BMI 27.4), was scheduled for tumor-wide excision, mandibulotomy, tracheostomy, and free flap reconstruction because of mouth floor squamous cell carcinoma.His medical history included hypertension and previous cystolitholapaxy for bilateral ureteral stones.The patient was taking losartan and hydrochlorothiazide and denied any drug allergies.A pre-operative chest radiograph (10 days before the surgery) showed a normal picture and an echocardiogram indicated normal left ventricular function.A mild productive cough was noted.\\\\nA standard monitoring set-up (electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and SpO2) was implemented before induction of anesthesia.Pre-operative vital signs were within normal range (heart rate, 74 bpm; blood pressure, 168/85 mmHg; respiration rate, 18 times per minute; and an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air).Following pre-oxygenation, general anesthesia was induced with remifentanil (target-controlled infusion: 3 ng/mL), lidocaine (20 mg), propofol (180 mg), and succinylcholine (80 mg).Oral tracheal intubation with a 7.5 mm endotracheal tube was performed using a video-assisted intubating stylet (Trachway®, Markstein Sichtec Medical Corp, Taichung, Taiwan).Airway secretion was found during the tracheal intubation procedure.Mechanical ventilation was set at a volume-controlled mode with the following settings: tidal volume (500 mL), respiratory rate (10 times per minute), and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP; 4 cmH2O).Sevoflurane at an end-expiration concentration of 2% and cis-atracurium were used for the maintenance of anesthesia.An arterial line was established through a radial artery for continuous beat-to-beat monitoring.\\\\nA cuffed 8.0 sized tracheostomy tube (Rota-TrachTM, Vitaltec, Taichung, Taiwan, ID 8.0 mm, OD 11.0 mm, TL 76 mm) was placed after an uneventful tracheostomy procedure.The endotracheal tube was then withdrawn without incident and no secretion impaction inside the tube was noted.However, SpO2 dropped from 100% to 96% during the course.An immediate recruitment maneuver with FiO2 1.0 was performed.When the tracheostomy was completed and ready for the second stage of the neck dissection procedure, the patient’s SpO2 continued to drop down from 96% to 89%.Peak airway pressure increased from 22 to 29 cmH2O, and EtCO2 decreased from 42 mmHg to 37 mmHg. Blood pressure was within normal range.Pure oxygen was given, and arterial blood gas (ABG) was checked, which revealed a low PaO2 (140 mmHg under FiO2 1.0).\\\\nMeanwhile, physical examinations revealed that chest wall movement was normal at the left side but significantly suppressed at the right side.Lung auscultation revealed significantly diminished breath sounds over the right chest with a mixture of coarse crackles and rhonchi.Malposition of the tracheostomy tube with one-lung ventilation was immediately excluded.Since the pre-operative chest radiograph taken 10 days before was normal and the patient did not present any infection signs (fever, leukocytosis, etc.), pneumothorax was an initial impression ready to be excluded.A bedside lung POCUS with a curved transducer (2.5 to 7.5 MHz) was immediately used to evaluate the lung images.\\\\nThe images of the lung POCUS showed decreasing lung sliding over the right upper lung field and a reduced sandy seashore sign with intermittent lung pulse on motion mode (M-mode; A).B-line was not observed within the 2nd and 5th intercostal space.Right mainstem intubation by the tracheostomy tube was excluded by fiberoptic bronchoscopy exam (the tip was within the trachea and above the carina).While advancing the bronchoscope past the right main bronchus, however, copious sticky yellowish sputum was encountered in the bronchial branches, especially at the right upper bronchus (B).A portable chest radiography was taken and showed partial atelectasis over the right upper lobe and increased interstitial lung density, which were compatible with the ultrasound findings (C).After adequate suctioning and recruitment maneuvers, an ABG analysis was repeated (PaO2 115 mmHg under FiO2 0.5).Because of suspected pneumonia and the planned long duration of the operation, the surgery was then deferred.Sputum culture was collected and empirical antimicrobial treatment with piperacillin and tazobactam was initiated.Haemophilus influenza was isolated from the sputum culture.After a 10-day antibiotic treatment course, a repeat chest radiograph was clear, and the patient received the pre-planned surgery uneventfully.', 'A 4.3-year-old boy was admitted on April, 2016 due to 5-day fever and cough.He was in good health and had never been to hospital.Two days before admission, pulmonary CT from other hospital suggested inflammatory consolidation with atelectasis.Therefore, the first FB was performed to etiological diagnosis and atelectasis treatment on admission.FB revealed fibrinoid formation in the right upper lobe.After 2 days of treatment of cephalothin and azithromycin, the condition worsened and hypoxemia developed.Arterial blood gas revealed PaCO2 43 mm Hg, PaO2 56 mm Hg, and oxygenation index 266.Then, reservoir mask of 6 l/min was adopted for ventilatory support.Physical examination revealed temperature 38.0°C, heart rate 135 beats/min, respiration 32 times/min, blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, and transcutaneous oxygen saturation 90% without oxygen administration, fatigue, and decreased respiratory sound in the right lung.Cardiovascular, nervous system, extremities, ANA, and ENA examinations were normal.Routine blood tests showed Hb 132 g/l, WBC 12.2 × 109/L, N 73.3%, and L 27.1%.The biochemical examination revealed a result of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 2,031 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 1,595 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 2,673 U/L, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) 41 U/L, triglyceride 1.33 mmol/l, procalcitonin (PCT) 1.56 ng/ml, CRP 38.8 mg/l, and ferritin 4,355 ng/ml.MP-DNA reaching 1 × 108 copies/ml in BAL fluid and MP resistance mutation site 2063/2064 were positive and MP-DNA of hydrothorax was 3.2 × 105 copies/ml.\\\\nOn the 2nd day, pulmonary CT suggested substantial pulmonary consolidation in the upper and middle lobes of the right lung accompanied by significant effusion ().Due to persistent fever and significant elevation on blood inflammatory indicators, an additional methylprednisolone of 10 mg/kg/d was added for anti-inflammation and it was applied for 14 days.B-ultrasound showed that the maximum depth of pleural effusion was about 70 mm.Then, thoracentesis was performed and 300 ml of light yellow liquid was drained.Due to plastic casts in the airway and persistent consolidations in X-ray, FB was performed on the 3rd day and 6th day again.His temperature returned to normal and blood oxygen improved on 7th day.On 9th day, B-ultrasound showed no pleural effusion.The chest X-ray was normal and the titer of MP-IgM was increased by eight times on the 14th day.This patient had a fever for a total of 7 days after admission and discharged with azithromycin (oral) on the 15th day ().No other etiological evidence was found in body fluid and secretions.She was followed-up without any discomfort on the 22nd and 52nd day.', ': A 70-year-old female was referred to our clinic because her NTG progressed.Her BCVA was 0.5 and 1.0, right and left eye, respectively.The IOP on glaucoma drops was 15 and 16 mm Hg, right and left eye, respectively.Both discs looked clearly glaucomatous with C/D = 0.8–0.9 with disc hemorrhage on the right side.However, the VF revealed bitemporal hemianopia hiding typical glaucomatous field loss.An MR scan was immediately performed and revealed pituitary macroadenoma (24 × 30 × 20 mm) affecting the chiasm.The tumor was removed by transsphenoidal resection.The VF improved very rapidly after surgery and has remained stable for 4 years.\\\\nSummary: this is a typical case of pituitary macroadenoma affecting the chiasm with progressive VF loss and typical bitemporal hemianopia.Coexistence of true glaucoma is rare; interestingly, the progression of glaucoma was halted after the tumor was excised.The influence of the adenoma on the optic disc appearance is uncertain.', 'Female, 44 y/o, affected by mitral valve (MV) dysplasia (parachute valve with double medioposterior papillary muscle) and subaortic stenosis caused by a fibromuscular ring, underwent subaortic membrane resection and septal myectomy in 1989.Due to worsening exertional dyspnea and persistence of subaortic stenosis, a St. Jude Regent 17 mm was implanted in 2006 (40 y/o) with improvement of her physical condition.In the last 2 years, TTE detected a progressive increase of the intraventricular gradient with LV hypertrophy (maximum speed, 4.1 m/s, maximum/median gradient: 64/39 mm Hg).TEE performed in May 2020 showed normal excursion of the prosthesis’ leaflets and confirmed severe subaortic stenosis (speed: 5.5 m/s, maximum/median gradient: 120/63 mm Hg) ().New subaortic membrane formation (SAM) was suspected but not clearly detected by TEE.MDCT provided accurate 3D reconstructions of the LV outlet tract (LVOT) with a better topographic assessment of the new SAM and its surrounding structures.The SAM was located 7 mm below the aortic prosthetic annulus, with the maximum thickness of 5 mm and hemicircumferential extension along the interventricular septal surface.This information was crucial to guide surgical excision of the SAM (a,b).', 'A 44-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency room with a 2-week history of anorexia, progressive weakness, and difficulty walking.She had a past medical history of obesity, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.Her past surgical history was significant for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery 23 years ago.The patient was functionally independent 2 months prior to admission with acute deterioration in the 2 weeks preceding the admission.\\\\nInitial examination revealed a markedly pale and malnourished woman with a body mass index of 14.9 who had lost 8 kg in the preceding 4 months.She had tachycardia with mild epigastric tenderness.She was awake and oriented to person, place, and time.Her pupils were equal, round, reactive to light, and her cranial nerve function was normal.Her strength was 4/5 in bilateral upper extremities and 3/5 in bilateral lower extremities, with preserved sensation.Normal reflexes including unsustained ankle clonus were present bilaterally.Laboratory tests on admission revealed the following: white blood cell count 4800/mm3 (normal); hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL (mildly low); mean corpuscular volume 111 fL (mildly high); blood glucose 106 mg/dL (normal); albumin 2.2 g/dL (low); prothrombin time 11.3 seconds (normal); total bilirubin 2.3 mg/dL (normal-high); alkaline phosphatase 201 U/L (normal); aspartate aminotransferase 175 U/L (high); alanine aminotransferase 65 U/L (high); ammonia 98 µmol/L (high); folate 16 ng/mL (normal); and vitamin B12 1745 pg/mL (normal).Hepatic ultrasound showed a moderately fatty liver without mass or cirrhosis.Initial therapy consisted of 100 mg thiamine, 1 mg folic acid, multivitamins, and magnesium sulfate.The patient’s home medications, quetiapine and clonazepam, were held.A nasojejunal tube was placed and feeding was started slowly.\\\\nThe day after admission the patient abruptly became nonverbal and responsive only to pain.She also developed flaccid paralysis of both arms and persistent rhythmic jerking of her legs and feet.These findings are not typical of Wernike or Wernike-Korsakoff syndromes.Refeeding syndrome (with encephalopathic/neurologic manifestations of electrolyte abnormalities) was considered; however, her repeat serum laboratory tests were unremarkable (including sodium of 140, glucose 80, and phosphate 2.9).Additionally, 1-hour electroencephalogram was negative for seizures.Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable, ruling out infectious and aseptic meningitis.Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed lesions involving the splenium of the corpus callosum and the posterior limb of both internal capsules ( and ).', 'A 22-year-old man presented with a 70-day history of bilateral lower extremities weakness, followed by fever, productive cough and jaundice.On March 20th 2017, the patient suddenly developed lower limb weakness without any other notable symptoms.After the patient’s admission to the local hospital, brain computed tomography (CT) scan found no abnormalities while the contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected multiple lesions in the brain and abnormal signals in spinal cord on T2 (Fig.', 'A 59-year-old left-handed female with a history of hypertension, steatohepatitis, hypothyroidism, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was brought to the emergency department (ED) with progressive altered mental status, abulia, and inability to care for herself.The family reported inadequate dietary intake and increasing forgetfulness in the last week.Her history was significant for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass bariatric surgery one month prior.The post-operative course was uneventful, and she was discharged home with normal mental status on nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).Three days later she was brought to the ED in a lethargic state after falling out of bed in the setting of CPAP noncompliance.She was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated.Computed tomography (CT) chest only showed small bilateral pleural effusions.She was eventually extubated and placed on a regimen of CPAP when asleep and transferred to the regular nursing floor.Despite adequate oxygenation, the patient remained arousable but disoriented with decreased attention span.Cranial nerve, motor and sensory examinations were normal.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed nonspecific white matter disease of the centrum semiovale (Figure ).\\\\nLumbar puncture revealed an elevated myelin basic protein.', 'An 8-year-old Chinese boy with no specific family or psychosocial history was admitted to our hospital with an emergency occurrence of purpura, severe hematemesis, large bloody stools, and sharp abdominal pain.His symptoms had begun 2 weeks prior to admission, with abdominal pain and an erythematous pinpoint rash on his arms.The rash developed from his upper limbs (opisthenar and arms) to his lower limbs.Laboratory examination in the outpatient clinic revealed no abnormalities in indicators such as white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin.After oral medication (specific unknown), his abdominal symptoms began to reduce, as did the purpura.Ten days prior, the rash progressed mostly on the legs, and he experienced deeper abdominal pain in the form of persistent pain with abdominal gassiness and emesis.He was admitted to another hospital with a diagnosis of HSP.Seven days prior, he had melena.After fasting and fluid replacement, there was no obvious improvement in the symptoms.Half a day prior, his face and lips appeared pale, and he had increased abdominal pain, accompanied by numerous bloody stools and hematemesis.He was immediately treated with methylprednisolone, posterior pituitary injection, somatostatin, and hemocoagulase, together with the infusion of large blood products (Table ).At this stage, the patient still produced large amounts of blood in the vomit and stool.His vital signs were extremely unstable, and he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of our hospital.The patient had purpura with lower limb predominance and abdominal pain (consistent with one of the following 4 criteria: abdominal pain, histopathology, arthritis or arthralgia, and renal involvement), and was diagnosed with HSP.[\\\\nOn admission, he had severe anemia, with a blood pressure of 76/44 mm Hg, pulse of 135 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min.There was also a palpable purpura rash on both legs, tenderness in the abdomen, and absence of bowel sounds.Routine blood examination revealed a hemoglobin level of 70 g/L, white blood cell count of 11.48 × 109/L, and platelet count of 13 × 109/L.The liver function test showed albumin 10 g/L.The serum electrolytes showed sodium 140 mmol/L, potassium 2.92 mmol/L, chloride 112.1 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 15.9 mmol/L (Table ) with coagulopathy.Therefore, HSP complicated with an alimentary tract hemorrhage was diagnosed.He was immediately treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg per day), infusion of blood products, and somatostatin but after 2 days after treatment (day 3), he still had massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, poor circulation, a reduced level of consciousness, and unstable vital signs.Abdominal ultrasonography and plain abdominal radiography revealed no enterobrosis.The patient was also evaluated by pediatric surgeons, and the continuation of medical treatment was suggested.However, his condition deteriorated, and he needed to rely on a life-supporting blood transfusion.He developed signs of peritonitis with abdominal distension.Gastrointestinal tract perforation was suspected.A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the whole abdomen revealed curved liquid samples and gas shadows on the left and front of the stomach, supporting the possibility of gastrointestinal tract perforation (Fig.).On day 4, an emergency laparotomy was performed.The surgery revealed that the anterior wall of the descending duodenum was thinner with a 1 cm × 1 cm diameter perforation, and the posterior wall had a 3 cm × 1 cm ulcer, which had penetrated into the peritoneum of the pancreas and experienced active bleeding from the broken end of the vessel.The intraoperative hemorrhage volume was approximately 3000 mL, including intragastric bleeding and intestinal blood clots.Pathological examination indicated chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall mucosa in the descending part of the stomach and duodenum, with hemorrhage, ulceration, interstitial congestion, and edema.Immunofluorescence microscopy of paraffin sections showed granular and lumpy IgA focal deposition in the blood vessel walls (Fig.).Postoperatively, he was administered nasal continuous positive airway pressure-assisted ventilation, anti-infection treatment, albumin transfusion, platelet transfusion, abdominal drainage, methylprednisolone, fluconazole antifungal treatment, and wound dressing.The general symptoms gradually improved, vital signs were stable, and abdominal pain was relieved.The drainage tube was assessed after discharge, the abdominal CT was repeated after 1 month and the duodenostomy tube was removed 50 days after surgery.There was no evidence of rebleeding during the 2-month follow-up assessment.', 'This 33-year-old female patient had typical COVID-19 symptoms such as high fever, dry cough, headache, and dyspnea about 1 week before ICU admission.She was intubated and proned due to rapid respiratory deterioration.For the following 6 days, her situation was unstable, and physical therapy consisted of prone positioning and prevention of secondary damage.From day 7 onwards, she started to improve rapidly and could be mobilized passively into a side-edge position.After extubation, she presented postextubation dysphagia and severe ICU-acquired weakness (MRC-SS 36/60).She also suffered from pronounced delirium and anxiety and said repeatedly that she had been abducted and that she believed she had to die.She seemed to feel threatened by us and it was difficult to calm her down.Due to the pandemic measures of the Swiss government, hospital visits were not generally allowed, but because her anxiety was limiting her rehabilitation, her husband was granted an exceptional permission to visit her.This seemed to give the patient a short sense of security, and she started to participate in some basic functional activities (CPAx 21/50).Nevertheless, the delirium did not resolve upon her transfer to a peripheral acute hospital.', 'A 70-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of fainting and general malaise for 5 years, worse in the prior 6 months.The symptoms were mainly triggered by flexing the neck and changing body position.There was no other discomfort and no significant past history.Her body mass index was 28.52, with blood pressure 144/77 mm Hg, and a radial pulse rate of 80 beats/min and regular.Physical examination showed slight pitting edema in both legs.She had no pathologic cardiac murmur or significant abdominal findings.The echocardiogram revealed a LV mass attached to the posterior wall near the apex, measuring 16.1 mm × 11.1 mm (Fig.).The mass had a well-defined border and moved when the heart contracted.LV function and outflow were not impaired.There was no associated thrombus or mass in any other chamber or on any valve.Laboratory tests, electrocardiography, coronary angiography, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormalities.\\\\nSurgery was performed through a limited median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass.', 'In November 2016, a Caucasian 75-year-old woman, a former smoker (7.5 pack-years), was hospitalized for breathlessness.Her past medical history included atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin, arterial hypertension treated with betaloxol, and gastroesophageal reflux.She ran a bar–tobacco shop with significant long-term exposure to passive smoking.She was not exposed to asbestos.Clinical examination on admission revealed good performance status, stage 1 modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea, crackles at lung bases, and no digital clubbing or extrathoracic signs.Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed interstitial lung disease (ILD) with subpleural reticulations without evidence of honeycombing or enlarged lymph node (Fig.).Standard biology, serological testing, bronchoscopy, and bronchoalveolar lavage were normal.Pulmonary function tests demonstrated bronchial obstruction [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, 0.66; FEV1, 97% of predicted values (% pred.)], preserved volumes [FVC, 121% pred.; total lung capacity (TLC), 111% pred.], and alteration of gas diffusion (TLCO, 62% pred.).ILD multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) reached a CT pattern of possible usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which led to the proposal of performing surgical lung biopsy.Wedge resection of the right upper and lower lobes was performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in July 2017.Both resected lung specimens showed a similar pattern of UIP: fibroblastic foci and honeycombing.In addition, the right lower lobe specimen displayed numerous disseminated foci of well-differentiated focally invasive SCC without invasion of visceral pleura (Fig.).Complete resection was obtained without SCC-positive surgical margins.A PET–CT scan performed in September 2017 showed mild hypermetabolism of ILD [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), 3.5], without hypermetabolic lung nodule, mass, or enlarged lymph node.Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal.', 'A 67-year-old female with a past medical history of iatrogenic hypothyroidism secondary to thyroidectomy stopped taking her levothyroxine over a year ago.Three months prior to her presentation, she had been experiencing progressively worsening confusion and respiratory distress.According to her family, she became bed-bound approximately a week before admission, when she was brought in by ambulance after being found unresponsive by family members.\\\\nOn admission, her vital signs were unremarkable with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute.Her physical examination was significant for lethargy, facial swelling, macroglossia, and bibasilar crackles of the lung fields.Laboratory findings were pertinent for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at 58.5 ng/dL and free thyroxine (T4) of 0.19 ng/dL.Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm with low voltage QRS complexes with electrical alternans (Figure ).The enlarged cardiac silhouette was noted on chest radiography (CXR) along with congested lung fields (Figure ).Following consultation with the endocrinology service, the patient was started on intravenous levothyroxine and hydrocortisone and admitted to medicine telemetry service for further management.\\\\nOn the following day, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a large pericardial effusion with the swinging of the heart in the pericardial sac with the diastolic collapse of both atria and the right ventricle (Figure , Figure , Figure ).The patient was upgraded to Cardiac ICU and underwent urgent pericardiocentesis with 1300 mL serous straw-colored fluid drained.Analysis of pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells.Acid-fast bacilli stain and culture were negative.The patient was discharged on levothyroxine.Serial TSH and T4 measurements over the subsequent two months showed normalization of both values.On six months follow-up, repeat TTE showed diminishing pericardial effusion without echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade.', 'A 53-year-old man with no medical history of arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, coagulation disorder, or stroke consulted our hospital complaining of back pain.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a 21-mm-diameter nodule in the lower left lung as well as multiple liver and bone metastases (Figure ), but no abnormalities in the brain.Percutaneous needle biopsy of the liver led to a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung (T1bN3M1c, cStage IVb) positive for an exon 19 deletion of the EGFR gene.\\\\nBefore initiation of treatment with gefitinib, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of a disturbance of consciousness and malaise.His ECOG PS was 4.A brain CT scan again showed no abnormalities, whereas laboratory tests revealed a decreased platelet count of 59,000/μl (normal range, 158,000 to 348,000/μl), an increased prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT-INR) of 1.35 (normal range, 0.90 to 1.10), and an increased fibrin degradation product level of 174.3 μg/ml (normal range, 0 to 8 μg/ml), suggestive of cancer-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation.Anticoagulant therapy with thrombomodulin alfa (380 U/kg) was initiated.Transthoracic echocardiography revealed no findings of valvular disease or intracardiac thrombus.On his second day in hospital, the patient was started on gefitinib at 250 mg/day, given that this drug has been shown to be safe and effective in EGFR mutation–positive NSCLC patients with a poor PS [].After 2 days of treatment with gefitinib, the patient presented with right hemiplegia, aphasia, and cognitive dysfunction.Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) revealed multiple acute cerebral infarctions (Figure ) and the patient was diagnosed with Trousseau syndrome.', \"A 36-year-old female presented with fever, weight loss, enlarged right axillary lymph node, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.The axillary lymph node biopsy (Figure ) revealed noncaseating granulomas typical for sarcoidosis.The patient was started on steroids and showed only mild improvement in symptoms.\\\\nOver the next few months, she exhibited gradually increasing leukopenia and thrombocytopenia [white blood cell (WBC) count 1.5-4 × 109/l and platelet count 45-100 × 109/l].A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and it confirmed the presence of noncaseating sarcoid granulomas.The patient was maintained on steroids, but no improvement in cytopenia was noted.\\\\nOne year after diagnosis, she presented again with fever, fatigue, and hepatosplenomegaly.Laboratory workup revealed the following: WBC count 0.1 × 109/l, hemoglobin 5.5 g/dl, platelet count 9 × 109/l, total bilirubin 1.4 g/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 151 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 125 IU/l, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 317 U/l, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 423 IU/l, and ferritin 67,590 ng/ml.The patient was treated with antibiotics but was persistently febrile.Blood cultures and viral and fungal studies were negative.Given worsening pancytopenia, very high ferritin and liver dysfunction, MAS was suspected.The fasting triglyceride level was 292 mg/dl, and the D-dimer level was 1001 ng/dl.However, the fibrinogen levels were normal.The sCD25 level was 10,440 pg/ml (ref < 1000 pg/ml) and the natural killer (NK)-cell activity was 4 LU30 (normal 7-125 LU30).A bone marrow biopsy (Figure ) demonstrated hypocellular marrow with normal hematopoiesis replaced by proliferation of histiocytes and vague granulomas.Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) stain and acid-fast bacilli stain (AFB), CD1a, S100, and CD23 were negative.\\\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement.\", 'A 56-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy by the gynecological team.The patient has a history of total abdominal hysterectomy 20 years prior for endometriosis.Therefore, adhesions were obscuring the anatomy of the left ureter during her later surgery.In the early postoperative days, there was mild pain at the left iliac fossa and was managed with paracetamol and oral morphine.In the early period, there was no flank pain and no costovertebral angle tenderness.One week later, the patient presented to the emergency department with severe left iliac fossa pain associated with nausea and vomiting.Her investigations were within normal range, stable renal function, and normal inflammatory markers.Contrast CT showed extravasation of the contrast at the level of the left renal pelvis (Figure ) and ureteric dilatation down to the pelvic ureter (Figure ).\\\\nConsidering the recent pelvic surgery, immediate diagnosis of left ureteric iatrogenic injury was concluded, and the patient was managed initially with urgent CT-guided nephrostomy insertion.The patient was in pain and an adequate nephrostogram was not performed during nephrostomy insertion.Therefore, three weeks posttraumatic injury, the patient underwent a proper antegrade nephrostogram.The contrast extravasated into the peritoneal cavity and there was no contrast passing into the distal left ureter (Figures , ).Therefore, a diagnosis of complete transection of ureteric injury was suspected.The nephrostomy was left in situ and the patient was planned for reconstructive surgery.\\\\nEleven weeks posttraumatic injury, the patient was admitted for her planned surgery.Prior to the surgery, left retrograde study was performed and surprisingly the contrast went up to the left kidney with only annular stricture at the level of the injury (Figures , ).Therefore, a decision was taken for ureteroscopic dilatation of the stricture.The ureteroscopy showed a small annular stricture, less than 0.5 cm, that was passed easily over the safety guidewire and a ureteric stent, size 8 French, was inserted successfully.', 'A 31-year-old man with a history of epilepsy presented twice to the Emergency Room (ER) in the span of 10 days after experiencing GTC seizures.On initial presentation, the patient had a witnessed seizure while at work and was postictal on arrival.While in the ER he again had a witnessed GTC seizure which broke 1 minute after receiving 2 mg of lorazepam intravenously.Almost immediately after the seizure, he became dyspneic and hypoxic despite a Nonrebreather (NRB) mask.He was subsequently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.Chest radiograph postintubation showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates (), and pink frothy sputum was seen collecting in the endotracheal tube (ETT).The ER team believed that this was blood related to a tongue laceration and suspected aspiration pneumonitis given the radiographic findings consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).The patient was loaded with 1 gram of intravenous levetiracetam, per neurology, and then restarted on his home regimen of 1 gram twice daily.He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), started on a course of ampicillin/sulbactam for possible aspiration pneumonia, and, due to a PaO2:FiO2 of 128 mm Hg, was started on inhaled epoprostenol and placed on lung protective ventilation.Brain computed tomography (CT) showed no acute intracranial abnormality, and continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) showed diffuse background slowing and occasional bifrontal spike and wave discharges that were thought to suggest frontal lobe epilepsy.ENT performed a bedside nasopharyngolaryngoscopy and found no upper airway source of bleeding.Repeat chest radiograph the following day showed rapid resolution of the initial bilateral infiltrates () with PaO2:FiO2 recovered to >200 mm Hg. His blood, urine, and sputum cultures were unremarkable, and influenza and respiratory syncytial virus polymerase chain reaction were negative.Antibiotics and inhaled epoprostenol were discontinued, and the patient was successfully extubated 48 hours after intubation.MRI brain showed mesial temporal sclerosis primarily affecting the left posterior hippocampus.', 'The proband is a 19-year-old male born from non-consanguineous parents of Caucasian origin, after a normal pregnancy at 40 weeks of gestation with normal birth measurements (weight 4150 kg, length 52 cm, and cranial circumference 36 cm).Both parents and the 18- year-old brother are healthy (Fig.).\\\\nNystagmus, convergent strabismus, and mild lower spasticity appeared at 7 months of age as the first symptoms of the disease, and subsequently, developmental psychomotor regression was observed.In particular, the child at 14 months lost the ability to walk alone, presenting ataxic signs, and at 16 months chorea of the arms and dystonia of the trunk appeared.\\\\nWe performed the first MRI showing the typical pattern of Leigh Syndrome with the presence of bilaterally hyperintense signals in the basal ganglia and thalami and of periventricular white matter (Fig.', 'A 34-year-old male was referred to our hospital where he presented a 6-month history of unilateral nasal obstruction and frontal headache.Endoscopic examination showed a polypoid mass in the right nasal cavity and permitted biopsy of the lesion.Histological findings documented an olfactory neuroblastoma of Grade II according to Hyams grading system.MRI was performed, revealing a well-circumscribed lesion in the right nasal sinus, hypointense on T1 weighted and hyperintense on T2 weighted sequences ().', 'A 1.9-year-old girl was referred to our hospital on March, 2016 due to 4-day fever and cough, with no pertinent past medical history.Physical examination revealed temperature 37.4°C, heart rate 120 beats/min, respiration 50 times/min, blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, and transcutaneous oxygen saturation 92% without oxygen administration, fatigue, and depressions in suprasternal fossa, supraclavicular fossa, and intercostal space.She developed hypoxemia, so the reservoir mask of 6 l/min was utilized for ventilatory support.The right lung showed diminished breath sounds.Cardiovascular, nervous system, extremities, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), and extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) examinations were normal.Routine blood tests showed the following results: hemoglobin (Hb) 118 g/l, white blood cell (WBC) 7.83 × 109/L, neutrophils (N) 53.3%, lymphocytes (L) 40.4%, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 156 mg/l.Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in artery (PaCO2) of 42 mm Hg, partial pressure of oxygen in artery (PaO2) of 50 mm Hg, base excess (BE) of 6.9 mmol/l, and oxygenation index of 238.Pulmonary CT suggested consolidation with atelectasis in the middle lobe of right lung ().\\\\nElectrocardiogram indicated sinus rhythm with blunt T wave of part of the lead, visible in double peak.The patient received cephalothin for anti-infection at admission.On 2nd day, due to pneumonia complicated with atelectasis in her CT scan, the first fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) was used to relieve atelectasis and obtain respiratory samples for bacteriologic, cytologic, and histologic detection.On 3rd day, the titer of MP-immunoglobulin M (IgM) was 1:160 and then azithromycin and methylprednisolone were applied for anti-inflammation.On 5th day, due to persistent fever, aggravated cough, and lesions on chest radiography progressed after conventional anti-infective therapy, the second FB was performed and found plastic bronchitis in the airway ().Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (BALF) was negative in other microorganism, except MP-DNA up to 5.1 × 108 copies/ml.MP resistance mutation site 2063/2064 showed positive.No other etiological evidence was found in body fluid or secretions.On 9th day, the body temperature returned to normal level and the clinical symptoms and imaging improved.\\\\nOn 14th day, the blood oxygen turned to normal and stopped oxygen inhalation.The titer of MP-IgM was increased to 1:10240.She was discharged on the 17th day.However, on 24th day, she had sudden high fever.Because she was still not getting better after 3-day conventional anti-infective therapy and persistent consolidations in X-ray, the third FB was used on 27th day on outpatient department and removed bronchial casts.Her temperature was normal on the next day and the chest X-ray on the 30th day had great improvement (, ).She did not present any discomfort within 60 days.', 'Patient 1: A 64-year-old man with a left inferior visual field deficit and headache.The CT angiography showed a left superior carotid-ophthalmic aneurysm (4 × 5 mm) ().', 'In October 2016, a 9-yr-old girl with chief complaint of nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and decreased level of consciousness referred to the Neurology Department of Namazi Hospital, Shiraz, southern Iran.\\\\nThe proband was the third offspring of healthy consanguineous parents (cousins).She had a healthy brother and sister.She was delivered through cesarean section due to oligohydramnios (birth weight = 2700 gr, body length = 48 cm).She had a short neck and trunk, pectus carinatum, and kyphosis.The first problem of the patient occurred at five months of age when growth retardation was detected in routine workup.Dental age was also delayed compared to chronological age.Indeed, bone survey showed delayed bone age, J-shaped sella, periarticular and diffused osteopenia, and flattening of thoracic vertebrae.She developed urinary tract infection when she was 11 months old.In voiding cystourethrogram, bilateral vesicoureteral reflux was diagnosed.Kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladder ultrasonography and renal scintigraphy were normal.\\\\nAt the age of 4 yr, urine analysis showed proteinuria for the first time and after more workups, nephrotic syndrome was confirmed.\\\\nShe had no new problems up to the age of 6 yr when she developed sudden onset right upper extremity paresthesia and weakness.Brain MRI was performed and showed ischemic and hemorrhagic infarct in the left parieto-occipital and left caudate lobe.', 'An 11-year old girl was admitted Mofid Children’s Hospital, Tehran, Iran in 2015 and we took her family informed consent form template for case report studies.She had high-grade fever, severe headache, and vomiting since four days before admission.She had been diagnosed with meningitis in another hospital and had received dexamethasone and antibiotics including ceftriaxone and vancomycin.No improvement had been seen in her status, and her high-grade fever had remained uncontrolled.The patient was referred to Mofid Hospital with complaints of high-grade fever, severe headacheand photophobia.Her mother reported that she had a history of common cold, sinusitis and pharyngitis few days before her first admission.\\\\nIn addition, she had a history of right knee arthritis last year; she also had a congenital occipital mass with occasional purulent discharge.It had been manipulated by her father because of pain and edema 2 weeks before her admission leading to oozing of pus.\\\\nOn physical examination, the patient was lethargic; vital signs included body temperature of 39 °C, blood pressure120/80 mm Hg, pulse rate 90/min, and respiratory rate 25/min.Meningeal irritation was present (positive nuchal rigidity, Kernig and Brudzinski signs) with photophobia; pupils midsize and were reactive to light.Erythematous occipital mass (1×2 cm) was palpated in the midline, with no discharge.The range of motion of right hip was decreased with tenderness without erythema, warmth and edema.The rest of the physical examination was normal.\\\\nBecause of continuation of fever despite antibiotic administration, lumbar puncture was done.CSF analysis in previous hospital admission showed; WBC=132(p=70%,L=28%), Glucose=10, Protein=27, RBC=180 and with a gram-negative bacilli (Enterobacter) in CSF culture.\\\\nLaboratory evaluations showed WBC=17000/mm3 (PMN=87%), Hemoglobin=12.6 g/dl, and Platelets=197000/mm3.Biochemistry tests including Na, K, P, amylase, lipase, and LDH were normal and serology for hepatitis b, hepatitis Cand CMV viruses was reported as negative.The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, (ESR) was 67 mm in the first hour and CRP 124 mg/l.NBT, Immune Globulins (Igs) and CD flow cytometry were also in normal range.Mild TR, Mild AIand Mild PI were reported in echocardiography without any vegetation.Audiometry also was normal.\\\\nCSF analysis in our hospital showed WBC=1000/mm3 with 90% PMN and 10% lymphocyte, Glucose=18mg/dl, Protein=30 mg/dl, RBC=10/mm3and CSF culture was negative.\\\\nAntibiotics were changed to vancomycin and meropenem in our hospital.After 3 days, the patient was not responding and had leukocytosis and fever, so chloramphenicol was added to vancomycin and meropenem.Five days later, CSF analysis showed WBC=100/ mm3 with 80% PMN and 20% lymphocyte, Glucose=25 mg/dl, Protein=18 mg/dl, RBC=60/mm3Blood culture was negative.Vancomycin and meropenem were discontinued and intrathecal amikacin was added to chloramphenicol.After five days, CSF analysis showed WBC=30/mm3with40% PMN and 60% lymphocyte, Glucose=29mg/dl, Protein=95mg/dl, RBC=10/ ml.The second CSF culture 8 days after admission showed gramnegative bacilli Enterobacter by BACTEC (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Model No. B9120).According to the antibiogram, microorganism was sensitive to chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole and resistant to ampicillin- sulbactam, amikacin, gentamicin and cefepime.Therefore, antibiotics were changed based on antibiotic sensitivity test (Amikacin was discontinued, chloramphenicol continued and cotrimoxazole added).Patient responded to the new antibiotic therapy clinically and CSF culture became negative.\\\\nBrain CT scan with and without contrast was performed for the patient which showed an extra-axial hypo dense relatively round lesion in posterior mid aspect of posterior fossa along with calcified foci in its superior aspect.A subcutaneous lesion was also noted in the overlying scalp.After contrast administration, rim enhancement was seen in both intracranial and subcutaneous lesions ().The lesion was suspected to be an infected intracranial and subcutaneous dermoid cyst with a connecting tract through the occipital bone, Brain MRI with and without contrast was performed subsequently which revealed CSF signal in the lesion and rim enhancement as well as prominent restriction in DWI sequence (Diffusion weighted imaging) which confirmed the diagnosis in the CT scan ().\\\\nShe was referred to the Neurosurgical Department for removal of the infected dermoid cyst.', 'Case 5 is a 61-year-old, right-handed male carrier with 89 CGG repeats, who denied any history of tremor.He noted that he had no history of falling but he experienced some instances of unsteadiness when turning around, possibly attributable to a 4 cm difference in leg lengths secondary to a congenital vascular malformation in one leg that impacted growth.On examination, his blood pressure was 107/68 mmHg and his heart rate was 55 bpm.He had a BMI of 26.5. There was no sign of tremor during finger-to-nose touching.Along with having mild balance problems while turning, he had instability on tandem walking during the first few steps.With practice, he was able to perform at least 6 steps without missteps.He had normal reflexes in his upper extremities and knees, all +2.His right ankle reflex was 1+, and there was no reflex in his left ankle.He had decreased vibration sense bilaterally in both big toes but normal vibration sense at the ankles bilaterally.Additionally, pinprick sensation was slightly decreased in the great toe.No cognitive abnormalities were present on neuropsychological examination and no psychiatric symptoms were reported.\\\\nOn MRI, the T2 images showed the MCP sign (Figure ) and white matter hyperintensity in the splenium of the CC.', \"A 25-year-old woman was admitted due to complaining of difficulty in swallowing.She was the youngest of the five siblings, also a non-smoker and non-drinker.She was a child of a consanguineous marriage as her father and mother are cousins.Furthermore, when she was five years old, she was diagnosed with Fanconi anemia.To confirm the diagnosis of FA, we communicated with the related university hospital for the records of the patients 20 years ago.They approved the diagnosis of FA with some peripheric blood sample studies without giving details.They had offered bone marrow transplantation, which the parents had not approved of.She had no major symptoms for 20 years, and the disease was under control.But the patient did not go to regular hospital check-ups.The patient's first notable characteristic was growth retardation manifested by short stature, microcephaly, and microphthalmia.Afterward, she had swallowing difficulty for the last two years and had lost around 10 kg in the last six months.\\\\nThe patient was referred to the gastroenterology department due to swallowing problems.In the endoscopic examination, stenosis was observed in the hypopharynx that restricts the passage of the scope follows through.Positron emission tomography (PET-CT) scan showed multiple lymphadenopathies in the bilateral deep cervical lymph nodes (standardized uptake value [SUV] max: 8.8), and prominent pathological 18F-Florodeoksiglukoz (FDG) involvement beginning from the right-side oropharynx to the proximal esophagus (SUV max: 8.5) (Figure ).The patient underwent endoscopy, tumoral formation in the hypopharynx leading to only 3 mm passage opening was detected.As a result of punch biopsy and pathological examination, squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx was revealed.\\\\nThe patient was diagnosed with T3N2cM0 hypopharyngeal cancer, and due to locally advanced disease, surgery was not considered; finally, she opted for curative radiotherapy (RT) with concomitant cetuximab chemotherapy.The RT of the patient was planned on a helical Tomotherapy system (Figure ), including primary tumour and bilateral neck lymph nodes.At the beginning of RT, the complete blood count was near-normal, with only mild leukopenia (white blood count is 3,8x10^3cells/uL).Cetuximab loading dose could not be administered due to urgent treatment needs.Consequently, the first cetuximab dose 350 mg/m2 with RT was initiated.The remaining maintenance dosage was scheduled as 250 mg/m2 but could not be administered due to a sudden drop in blood count (white blood count to 0.48x10³cells/uL) after four days of initial cetuximab and 10 days of RT.Her treatment was terminated due to progressive cytopenia (Table ), after receiving 21.2 Gy in 10 days for primary lesion.A peripheral blood smear was investigated, and it was concordant with severe pancytopenia as no atypical cells with rare leukocytes and platelets.To secure hematological recovery, G-CSF was initiated, erythrocyte and platelet transfusion was administered when necessary.Despite the daily G-CSF utilization, there was no significant change in blood counts.Moreover, the patient's dysphagia was worsened and a nasogastric tube was placed for feeding, in addition to parenteral nutritional support.Despite receiving nasal oxygen, the patient's condition worsened, on the 30th day of the start of radiotherapy, and her oxygen saturation regressed, and she was intubated.The patient died 40 days after radiotherapy begin due to respiratory failure and sepsis.\", 'A 72-year-old male, known hypertensive on medication, non-smoker, no family history of cancer presented with complaints of pain in the right hip with difficulty in walking in January 2019.On evaluation, a pathological fracture was found at the neck of the right femur.Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was done, which revealed osteophyte complexes at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6 vertebrae causing narrowing of neural foramina.Multiple T2-hyperintense lesions in lung parenchyma were an incidental finding.Upon further evaluation with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan of the whole body, mass in the apex of the right lung, right hilum, mediastinal lymph node, soft tissue wall thickening in the proximal stomach along with multiple liver and bone metastases were found.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed a proximal gastric growth from which a biopsy was taken.Histopathology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.A provisional diagnosis of carcinoma stomach with distant metastasis was reached.But immunohistochemistry came out to be positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin-7 (CK-7), while negative for cytokeratin 20 (CK-20) (Figures -).\\\\nSo, a possibility of metastasis from a lung primary was considered.It was confirmed by a biopsy from the lung mass that revealed adenocarcinoma as the histopathology.On immunohistochemistry, it was positive for TTF-1 and CK-7 while negative for CK-20 and synaptophysin.Analysis for anaplastic lymphoma kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and receptor tyrosine kinase 1 were all negative but programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) was 90%.So, the final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma lung with multiple lung, liver, femur, as well as gastric metastases.\\\\nFor the pathological fracture, he underwent fixation by intramedullary nailing followed by palliative external beam radiotherapy 8 Gy in a single fraction.He received 10 three-weekly cycles each of Inj.pembrolizumab 200 mg as intravenous infusion and Inj.denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously from March 2019 to September 2019.An interim PET-CT scan done after four cycles of immunotherapy in June 2019 showed a near-complete metabolic response (Figures -).\\\\nAfter 10 cycles, Inj.pembrolizumab was discontinued as the patient was unwilling to continue due to personal reasons.He was then started with chemotherapy, Inj.pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and Inj.bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in October 2019.Following this, the patient developed grade 1 maculopapular rash, pedal edema, and grade 2 diarrhea, which were managed conservatively.After that the patient did not opt for the continuation of chemotherapy.The next visit of the patient was in February 2021 with complaints of cough and breathlessness.On re-evaluation with PET-CT scan, progressive disease was found in the primary site (Figures , ).\\\\nPalliative radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the primary lesion was delivered through anteroposterior and posteroanterior portals of 10 megavolt energy each in April 2021 via linear accelerator (Elekta-Versa HD) which was tolerated well (Figure ).\\\\nIn June, the patient developed an altered sensorium and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of brain revealed multiple brain metastases for which the patient received palliative whole-brain radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 10 fractions over two weeks from the same linear accelerator.His condition further deteriorated, and in July, the patient succumbed to disease progression.', 'The first case was that of a 37-year-old man.At admission, the patient was diagnosed with septic shock, previous total cystectomy with ileal bladder replacement, urinary retention with pyuria, chronic renal insufficiency stage V, and neurogenic bladder.In addition, the patient’s vital signs were unstable, and noradrenaline and phenylephrine were required to maintain blood pressure after fluid resuscitation.Blood culture analyses were negative.Escherichia coli [extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) +], Enterococcus avium, and Enterococcus faecium were detected in the drainage fluid of the ileostomy.The antibiotic regimen at admission was 1000 mg meropenem q12 h ivgtt combined with vancomycin (loading dose on D1 of 1500 mg and maintenance dose of 1000 mg on D2).CVVH was also administered.From D7, the patient’s condition tended to be stable, and the CVVH frequency was reduced to every other day.On D9, puncture and catheterization of left subphrenic effusions were conducted under the guidance of B-ultrasound.Escherichia coli (ESBL+) and Enterococcus avium were identified in the drainage fluid.The intra-abdominal infection improved and the function of organs other than the kidney returned to normal.On D22, the culture of drainage fluid was negative, thus vancomycin and meropenem were stopped.On D26, the patient was transferred out of the intensive care unit and resumed routine hemodialysis.', 'A-50-year-old female presented with history of headache for a long time.Her neurological examination was normal.The laboratory results were within normal limits.Brain MRI demostrated a small herniation of a temporal lobe with surrounding CSF rim into the left transverse sinus (Figures , arrows).', 'Patient 2.II.1 (a right) is a male diagnosed at the age of 34 years old.He presented with high serum ferritin levels (but <1000 µg/L) and high serum iron.In addition, he had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism treated with testosterone and moderate hepatic steatosis.As expected for an iron overload disease, the hepcidin levels of the patient were low (0.1919 ng/mL).One year later, serum ferritin levels peaked to 3942 µg/L.Magnetic resonance shows no evidence of iron overload in the heart while in the liver revealed increased iron concentration of 47 µmol/g indicative of hepatic iron overload (normal values <36 µmol/g).Iron chelation with Desferoxamine was used as the main therapeutic treatment.Initially, phlebotomies were performed in combination with iron chelation but had to be stopped due to intolerance.Iron chelation treatment ended in 2020 and the patient is now asymptomatic.The patient will continue with maintenance therapy.\\\\nPatients A.II.1 and A.II.2 (b upper first panel) are two male brothers of Asian origin diagnosed with HH at 35 and 37 years old respectively.Both presented with high levels of serum ferritin and iron, while in both patients, the hepcidin levels were 0.2395 and 0.0111 ng/mL respectively.Hepatic magnetic resonance showed a severe hepatic iron overload (282.97 µmol Fe/g and 265 µmol Fe/g).The treatment option for both patients consisted of weekly phlebotomies in combination with iron chelation (Desferoxamine).A.II.1 proband started the phlebotomies in January 2019 (weekly) and the Desferoxamine treatment in May 2019.In February 2021, after 100 phlebotomies and approximately 22 g of iron removal the ferritin levels dropped to normal levels, but transferrin saturation remained high.A.II.2 proband started the phlebotomies in July 2017 (once a month) and the Desferoxamine treatment in January 2018 (initial dose of 1080 mg/day that eventually was increased to 2160 mg/day in May 2018).At the last data available (February 2021), the patient accumulated a total of 46 phlebotomies that removed a total amount of 9 g of iron and resulted in the normalization of ferritin and transferrin saturation parameters.The iron depletion was partially confirmed by the last hepatic magnetic resonance performed to the A.II.2 patient that showed a moderate iron overload (70.33 µmol Fe/g).', 'A 20-day-old girl was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with a chief complaint of poor oral intake through the emergency room.She was lethargic and did not suck well with swallowing only 10 to 20 mL of formula at a time in the last two days.However, the amount of urine did not decrease, and diapers were changed 10 to 14 times per day.Vomiting and diarrhea were not observed.She was born at 38+2 weeks of gestation with 3380 g (50th–75th percentile) via cesarean section.No abnormal findings were noted during the prenatal and immediate postnatal periods.She was the first child of healthy, nonconsanguineous Korean parents, and her family history was unremarkable.At admission, her weight was 3100 g (25th–50th percentile), length was 53 cm (50th–75th percentile), and head circumference was 36 cm (50th–75th percentile).Although vital signs were appropriate for her age (heart rate 150 beats/min, blood pressure 78/50 mmHg, respiratory rate 48 breaths/min, and body temperature 36.5 °C), her lips were dry, and the capillary refill time was prolonged to 5–6 s.Physical examination revealed both thumbs in palms, frontal bossing, prominent upper lip, high arched palate, sparse frontal scalp hair, and bilateral 5th finger clinodactyly.An initial capillary blood gas analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.16, pCO2 28.3 mmHg, pO2 42 mmHg, HCO3−—17.3 mmol/L, base excess—17.3 mmol/L).With an impression of dehydration, 20 mL/kg normal saline was infused intravenously for over 1 h before other laboratory results were obtained.\\\\nThe laboratory tests at admission were as follows: serum sodium 113.3 mEq/L, serum potassium 8.79 mEq/L, serum chloride 90.8 mEq/L, total CO2 8.1 mEq/L, serum lactic acid 1.0 mmol/L, serum ketone body 24 µmol/L, blood glucose level 83 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 55.1 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 0.65 mg/dL.Her urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.014 and pH 5.0 and was negative for white blood cells and red blood cells.Her spot urine sodium and potassium levels were 74 and 27.7 mEq/L, respectively.The serum and urine osmolality values were 232 and 229 mOsm/kg, respectively.All the results of the neonatal screening test were normal, which included TSH (1.2 mIU/L), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (1.6 ng/mL), total galactose (1.0 mg/dL), and mass spectrometry for amino acid, organic acid, fatty acid, purine, peroxisome, and carbohydrate metabolic disorders.The plasma ammonia level was within the normal limit as 97 µg/dL.The plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone level were markedly elevated to 142.0 ng/mL/h (normal range, 0.32–1.84 ng/mL/h) and 4560 ng/dL (normal range, 4.2–20.9 ng/dL), respectively.Renal ultrasonography revealed no abnormalities except mild hydronephrosis in the right kidney ().No abnormal findings were found in cardiac echocardiography or brain magnetic resonance imaging.\\\\nTo correct severe hyponatremia, 60 mL of 3% sodium chloride was initially intravenously administered over 8 h.Her urine output on the first day of admission was 8.45 mL/kg/h.Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were improved with intravenous fluid and oral sodium chloride supplementation (8 mEq/kg/day).The patient consumed an adequate amount of milk (170–200 mL/kg/day), and weight gain was appropriate (40–80 g/day) after oral sodium chloride supplementation.\\\\nFor the genetic diagnosis of the patient, targeted exome sequencing (TES) was performed.Genomic DNA was extracted from proband blood.All exon regions of all human genes (~22,000) were captured by a Twist Human Core Exome Kit (Twist Bioscience, South San Francisco, CA, USA).The captured regions of the genome were sequenced using a NovaSeq 6000 sequencing machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).In TES, no other pathogenic/likely pathogenic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) or small insertion and deletion variants associated with the clinical phenotypes were identified.However, her clinical phenotypes and biochemical results indicated PHA1.Therefore, we performed a chromosomal microarray (CMA) to identify deletion-encompassing genes responsible for PHA1.CMA (CytoScan Dx, Affymetrix Cytogenetics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) revealed a 203 kb heterozygous deletion at 4q31.23: arr[GRCh37] 4q31.23(148865586_149069090)x1 ().This deletion spans exons 7–9 of NR3C2 and exons 15–23 of the ARHGAP10 gene.Haploinsufficiency of the NR3C2 gene, which encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor, is responsible for ADPHA1.However, the details of the functional role of the ARHGAP10 gene in human disease remain unclear.Parental testing showed that the deletion was paternally inherited.Her father had no history of clinical PHA1 manifestation and had normal plasma electrolytes and serum aldosterone values with only slightly elevated plasma renin activity at testing.', 'A 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, essential hypertension, class 3 obesity, depression, and poor social and economic background was intermittently followed during the previous four years for persistent cutaneous candidiasis with intertrigo in the inframammary, inguinal, and lower abdominal regions (Figure ).\\\\nShe had been treated with topical antifungal, oral fluconazole and oral itraconazole with no improvement, which was believed to be because of poor hygiene and questionable therapeutic compliance.A worsening in the skin rash with exudate, pruritus, and a change to a violaceous colour, with scaly papules and vesicles (Figures , ) led to the performance of a skin biopsy which revealed (Figure ) orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis in the epidermis with areas of parakeratosis and, in the papillary dermis, there was an infiltrate of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and reniform nuclei that showed positive CD1a and S100 proteins on the immunohistochemistry and negative CD163 (Figure ).\\\\nThe patient denied constitutional, musculoskeletal, neurological, or urinary complaints.She underwent a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), thoracic-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy.', 'A 46-year-old African male with a past medical history of essential HTN presented to the emergency department with a five days history of cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, muscle cramping, fatigue, poor oral intake and decreased urinary output.The patient was tested positive for COVID-19 one day prior to admission.On further examination, the patient was febrile, hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 125/57 mmHg with a mean arterial pressure of 77 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 per minute, and oxygen saturation was 93%.The patient was adequately oxygenated on a 2 L nasal cannula.Initial lab report revealed 133 meq/L of Na, chloride 88 meq/L, potassium 6.3 meq/L, calcium 8 meq/L, creatinine 23 mg/dL, BUN 195 mg/dL, creatinine kinase 1,200 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 212 U/L, C-reactive protein 126.6, and elevated D-dimer 4,433 (Table ).Arterial blood gas showed bicarbonate 6 meq/L, CO2 6 mmol/L, anion gap 41 mmol/L, PH 7.17.His liver function panel was normal.Urinary analysis showed protein >600 mg/dL, blood 1+, creatinine 404.6 mg/dL, and urine protein electrophoresis was 1,735 mg.\\\\nEKG findings were non-significant for hyperkalemia, Chest x-ray was negative for the acute process of viral infection (Figure ).Since the patient was dehydrated he was started on 2 L of normal saline followed by 1 g of calcium gluconate.Repeat potassium was 7.7 meq/L.Therefore, the patient was admitted to the COVID ICU followed by a nephrology consultation.Since remdisivir is not a good drug of choice in renal dysfunction, 6 mg of decadron was started and sodium bicarbonate drip was started at 150 mL/hr.Additional investigation including color Doppler ultrasound of lower extremities was done due to high D-dimer and was negative for deep vein thrombosis.Ultrasound of kidney and urinary bladder was also negative for hydronephrosis.Despite the lack of improvement in supportive treatment, the patient was scheduled for hemodialysis.Subsequently his renal function and electrolytes status improved.Creatinine decreased to 3.1 mg/dL, creatinine kinase 895 IU/L, and the anion gap trended to 15.On discharge, potassium was 4.4 meq/L, creatinine was 2.9 mg/dL and he was sent home on room air with four more days of decadron and pulmonary rehabilitation exercise was done to enhance the recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia.', 'In December 2010, a 54-year-old German man presented to our hospital with suspected cerebral toxoplasmosis.HIV infection had been diagnosed in 1995.He had received a triple-combination highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) of lopinavir, lamivudine, and tenofovir, which was stopped in 2009 due to intolerable side effects (diarrhea, nausea).\\\\nOver a period of 5 days, progressive neurological deficits including sensorimotor paresis of his right leg and deterioration of alertness occurred.\\\\nOn clinical and neurological examination, he showed high-grade flaccid paralysis of his right lower limb with preserved muscle proprioceptive reflexes and positive Babinski sign.\\\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on day 1 revealed a periventricular hyperintense lesion with perifocal edema in the left parieto-occipital region which continued to progress as shown in imaging on day 6 (Fig.', 'A patient in her late seventies was incidentally found to have a large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm in 2013 for which she had undergone an uneventful percutaneous endovascular aortic repair with left chimney.She lived alone, remained independent in her activities of daily living, and was community ambulant without aid.\\\\nShe was electively admitted in September 2019 for embolization of a type 2 endoleak by the interventional radiologist.Super selective cannulation of the distal aspect of the iliolumbar branch supplying the nidus with a micro catheter was performed.Embolization was carried out using Onyx® until complete exclusion of the nidus.This was followed by repeat aortogram, which showed complete exclusion of the nidus from right-sided branches.However, there was continued filling of the nidus from the left lumbar branches.It was therefore decided to embolize the left side.After embolization, angiogram showed complete exclusion of the endoleak and the left-sided branches supplying the endo leak.\\\\nFive hours after the procedure the patient complained of bilateral lower limb weakness and numbness, right more than left.Physical examination revealed lower motor neurone pattern of weakness over bilateral lower limbs, right worse than left (Table ).Sensation testing revealed normal sensation over left, impaired sensation for right L2 to S1.Proprioception at bilateral big toes was intact.Reflexes were absent in bilateral lower limbs.\\\\nLumbar spinal drain was inserted to decompress the spinal cord to allow more arterial flow as there was concern with spinal cord ischemia.The patient was started on fluid replacement to maintain the mean arterial pressure above 80 mm Hg. Urgent CT aortogram followed by MRI thoracolumbar spine was performed.', 'A 75-year-old Caucasian woman, gravida 5, para 3 with past medical history of hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease arrived to the emergency department looking for relief from dental pain.Neither initial exam nor maxillary plain film showed evidence of cause for facial pain, and she was admitted for further evaluation and pain control.On reevaluation, she was noted to have diplopia and facial droop, so MRI brain along with MRI/MRA of head and neck with and without contrast was ordered to rule out cerebrovascular accident (CVA).', 'We report a case of a 58-year-old African American male with a long history of scaly itchy feet.The patient presented to the clinic on February 8th, 2018 with an apparent inflammatory reaction on the plantar surface of both feet ( and ).An initial specimen collection from the patient’s plantar surface revealed hyphae indicative of a fungal infection under KOH preparation.This supported the diagnosis of a tinea pedis infection.The patient was treated with ketoconazole topical cream and 20% Urea creams to be applied daily.Follow-up approximately 6 weeks later revealed resolution of underlying fungal infection with minimal remaining inflammation ( and ).With consideration to the subject’s initial presentation of a possible exaggerated immune reaction caused by Trichophyton, we suspected an underlying allergic response (delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction) to the fungus, instead of a cutaneous fungal infection alone.In order to test this hypothesis, we subjected the patient to intradermal skin testing with intradermal Candida and Trichophyton allergens.On March 21, 2018, the patient underwent application of Candida, normal saline, and Trichophyton allergens on the left volar forearm ( and ).', 'The patient was a 41-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of hepatitis C, hemiplegic migraine, and diverticulitis.He was well until 2011 when he first developed a severe headache followed by right-hand weakness and numbness.He was taken to the hospital where a diagnosis of hemipalegic migraine was made.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed some white matter changes thought to be secondary to hemiplegic migraine at that time.', 'Patient B.II.1 (b upper second panel) is a male of 46 years old diagnosed in 2012 with hemochromatosis that presented with hyperferritinemia and severe hepatic iron accumulation (300 µmol Fe/g) detected by hepatic magnetic resonance.The patient also suffers from dyslipidemia and internal hemorrhoids.The patient does not consume alcohol and is an ex-smoker as of May 2014.Genetic analysis shows that this patient is a carrier for the Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene.Secondary to the hemochromatosis, the patient presents with severe chronic arthropathy in feet, spine (spondylarthrosis) and hands.The treatment initially was monthly erythroapheresis (later, the rate of erythroapheresis was reduced to once every two months).In January 2015, phlebotomies were introduced as part of the treatment.In May 2017, the hepatic magnetic resonance showed no sign of hepatic iron overload.', 'An 80-year-old woman with a history of subarachnoid haemorrhage was brought to the emergency room because of speech problems.The patient was found in the morning by her relatives with severe speech comprehension and production difficulties.The exact time of symptom onset was unclear.Clinical examination at the ER revealed a sensory aphasia without other neurologic deficits.Stroke was suspected and the patient underwent a brain CT with an optimized stroke protocol consisting of an unenhanced CT, perfusion CT, and a CT angiography.Unenhanced CT showed no abnormalities, apart from already known and unchanged chronic hypodense gliotic changes in the left temporo-insular region (Figure ).Perfusion CT showed a normal to slightly diminished mean transit time (MTT), a diminished time to drain (TTD) and a clearly increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the entire left parietotemporal region (Figure ).No intra-arterial clots were seen on CT angiography.Urgent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed.', 'A thirty-year-old male presented with fever and non-productive cough for 2 weeks with exertional dyspnoea.He had hypertension and renal impairment due to mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, diagnosed 3 months prior to current presentation, and was on bisoprolol, prazosin and prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day).Renal biopsy had not shown evidence of vasculitis.\\\\nOn examination he was emaciated (BMI 18 kg/m2), febrile (38.2 °C), and had coarse crackles over right upper lung.Other system examinations were unremarkable.\\\\nThe patient had a pancytopaenia with neutropaenia (neutrophil count 780 / mm3) and dysplastic hypoproliferative bone marrow.Peripheral blood detected cytomegalovirus (29,000 copies per microliter by PCR) and anti-CMV IgM was positive.After 21 days of ganciclovir (100 mg daily IV), CMV viral load became undetectable and pancytopaenia was corrected.\\\\nContrast enhanced CT-chest showed right upper lobe consolidation with cavities (Fig.).Sputum smear for acid fast bacilli, culture and PCR for mycobacteria (Xpert MTb/RIF) were negative.However, tuberculosis PCR (IS6110 method) performed on his bone marrow aspirate was positive.Therefore, anti tuberculous therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide were commenced for disseminated tuberculosis.But, the response was poor..Aspergillus fumigatus was detected on bronchoalveolar lavage wet smear and culture.Both lavage and serum were positive for galactomannan antigen.Therefore voriconazole 500 mg twice daily (oral) was commenced.\\\\nOn sixth week of voriconazole, the patient developed acute bilateral lower limb ischaemia.Two emboli occluding bilateral popliteal arteries were extracted during emergency embolectomy (Fig.).Histology of emboli showed fungal filaments and culture isolated Aspergillus fumigatus.Trans-esophageal echocardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the aorta were normal.', 'A 26-year-old right-handed white woman with no significant medical history was diagnosed as having MS in 2013 at age 22 and experienced ongoing radiologic activity on both glatiramer acetate and dimethyl fumarate.She transitioned to natalizumab in July 2014 to stabilize disease activity, and her JCV antibody index was positive at 3.58 prior to starting natalizumab.She became clinically and radiologically stable with the initiation of natalizumab until November 2016 when a surveillance MRI of her brain showed asymmetric confluent non-enhancing hyperintensities in the bilateral subcortical precentral gyri consistent with PML (Fig.', 'A 31-year-old woman with spells preceded by visual symptoms of macropsia and micropsia and olfactory auras presented for further evaluation.Following the auras, the patient often exhibited right eye deviation and tonic flexion of the right upper extremities followed by a loss of awareness and generalized tonic-clonic events of 2–3 min in length.Afterwards, the patient experienced mild confusion and was tired for tens of minutes.She also had jerking of her arms and legs during sleep and the patient’s husband was unable to arouse her.The patient’s auras occurred every few days.She had 1–2 daytime spells a month, and she estimated that she had several more nighttime spells.These spells had been captured on routine EEG and during two EMU admissions and no electrographic change suggestive of seizure was noted.Neither a CT nor an MRI demonstrated any structural brain abnormalities.', 'A 25-year-old woman with a past medical history of polysubstance abuse presents to the ED with a chief complaint of severe headaches that wake her from sleep and are present on awakening.She has tried NSAIDS without any improvement.She admits to alcohol, marijuana, and methamphetamine use and asks for Vicodin.Her physical examination is normal, and a non-contrast CT of the brain is normal.She is discharged with a limited supply of Vicodin and referred to outpatient neurology for migraine management.Her insurer is Medicaid, and she finds it difficult to visit a neurologist who will accept her insurance.She returns to the ED seven additional times with the same complaint.On her most recent visit, she complains of transient visual obscurations that gray out or black out her vision for seconds to minutes.She is again referred to Neurology and this time to Ophthalmology as well.Again, no one accepts her insurance and she presents to the ED for an eighth visit.On this visit, she complains of severe central visual loss bilaterally and on examination is unable to see more than the “big E” on the Snellen eye chart bilaterally.Her pupils are round but minimally reactive to light.No afferent pupillary defect (APD) is present.A fundoscopic exam is not obtained given that she is uncooperative (crying hysterically), there is no protocol for pupil dilation, and a non-mydriatic camera is unavailable.The ophthalmologist on call is slow to answer and the patient is admitted but unfortunately, the call group does not cover inpatients.\\\\nWomen of childbearing age who are overweight are the population most at increased risk for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (high intracranial pressure with no specific cause) [,,,].It can also occur in women of normal BMI as well as men [,,].Exposure to steroids, doxycycline, or other medications can trigger this disorder [,,].\\\\nEarly morning headaches should raise concern for increased intracranial pressure and/or an intracranial mass.The headaches often get worse when laying down (gravity dependent) and can be accompanied by transient visual loss when changing from lying to sitting or standing [,,].Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is serious and must be addressed.Patients who complain of early morning headaches should always have their eyes examined for papilledema whether or not they have visual symptoms [,,].High Intracranial pressure (ICP) causes insidious visual field loss that begins in the periphery and is seldom noticed early on [,,,].In some patients, diplopia also occurs due to the sixth cranial nerve being stretched across the petrous ridge [,].\\\\nThe clinical history is critically important in this case too.Key symptoms are listed in .Patients should be asked about transient graying out or blacking out of vision especially when going from lying down or sitting to standing [,,].This patient ideally would have been referred to ophthalmology at the initial visit and had a non-mydriatic photo taken of the optic nerve.Rather than a non-contrast CT scan, an MRI/MRV of the brain would have been the imaging study of choice [,].', 'A 62-year-old immunocompetent man with no significant previous medical history was hospitalized for high-grade fever, intractable hiccup, and interscapular pain.On admission, his white blood cell count was 11 × 109/L (normal range 4.50–10.80 103 mmc), his C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated at 4.30 mg/dl (normal range 0.00–0.75 mg/dl), while his chest radiograph, abdomen ultrasound, and echocardiography were normal.A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain revealed a diffuse abnormal pattern (presence of aspecific inflammatory material) with hypodense lesions located in the trigonum of lateral ventricle in an underlying condition of demyelination and gliosis, suspicious for chronic ischemic vascular disease.A broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and ceftriaxone was initiated.The patient became afebrile within a few days.A neurological examination found him to be alert and oriented, and he did not have a stiff neck.However, the patient had persistent hiccups and headache.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enhancement of both trigeminal nerves and white spot lesions on the pons, cerebral peduncle, midbrain, and thalamus.', 'A 27-year-old woman presented with a progressive painless visual loss in both eyes for one week prior to consultation.It was associated with preceding headache, nausea, and vomiting of two months duration.There was no history of prolonged fever, chronic cough, reduced weight, or loss of appetite.However, her father was treated for pulmonary tuberculosis two years ago and he had completed his anti-tuberculosis therapy.\\\\nHer best corrected visual acuity was 3/60 (OD) and 4/60 (OS).The optic nerve function tests were impaired bilaterally and included light brightness, contrast sensitivity, and color vision; however, the right sight was more affected than the left.There was a relative afferent pupillary defect presence on her right eye.The confrontation test revealed generalized haziness with dense central scotoma on her bilateral vision.The anterior segment examination and intraocular pressure were essentially normal.The fundoscopy examination revealed bilateral papilledema.The optic discs were swollen and elevated with peripapillary flame-shaped hemorrhages as well as the presence of macular exudates (Figure ).However, no sign of vitritis or panuveitis was observed.\\\\nOn presentation, she was alert and orientated to time, place, and person.Her vital signs were stable.She was also afebrile.There were no signs of meningism or localizing signs.A respiratory examination revealed crepitation in the right lung.The other cranial nerves examinations were normal.The rest of the systemic examinations were unremarkable.\\\\nHer baseline blood investigations were unremarkable except for an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (79 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (23 mg/l).The human immunodeficiency virus antibody test was negative.The Mantoux test was positive (16 mm area of induration).The sputum microscopic examination detected the presence of acid-fast bacilli.The chest radiograph showed cavitations at the right lower zone (Figure ).\\\\nThe computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain and orbit revealed the presence of multiple ring-enhancing hyperdense lesions with central hypodensity and perilesional edema.The lesions were located at the anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle (Figure -).There were also multiple small lesions at the cerebrum and cerebellum (Figure ).\\\\nHowever, there was no traction over the septum pellucidum.The lateral and third ventricles were dilated on both sides.She declined further diagnostic tests, including lumbar puncture and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) of the brain and orbit.', 'A 22-year-old male presented in the emergency department with acute onset of swelling and redness over the right side of the neck and chest wall for the last three days.He had features of septicemia such as drowsiness or Glasgow Coma Scale score of 11/15, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, pulse rate of 130 beats per minute, blood pressure of 84/56 mmHg, and urine output of 15 mL/hour.He had no history of chronic disease, drug reaction, trauma, unknown bite, or significant familial disease.Blood investigations revealed low hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, raise leukocyte count of 28000/mm3, low albumin of 2.2 g/dL, raised serum creatinine of 2.23 mg/dL, serum urea of 174 mg/dL, and low sodium of 125 mEq/L.Serological markers including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (95 mm/hour) and procalcitonin (25.2 ng/mL) were higher.X-ray of the chest was grossly normal (Figure ), and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the neck revealed irregular, well-defined, hypodense, non-enhancing area in the right parotid gland with extension into the neck spaces, larynx, and subcutaneous planes (Figure ).CECT of the chest revealed mild effusion in bilateral pleural space secondary to acute infection and no evidence of lymphadenopathy or osteomyelitis (Figures , ).\\\\nZiehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining from pleural fluid was negative for acid-fast bacillus (AFB bacilli).The patient was managed in the intensive care unit with ventilator support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome.He was diagnosed with acute progressive necrotizing fasciitis with multiple organ dysfunction syndromes due to an unknown cause of septicemia.He underwent multiple aggressive debridements of the neck and chest wall (Figure ).\\\\nThe cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) and ZN staining revealed positive mycobacteria and AFB bacilli for pathological tissue.Therefore, the pus collected in the parotid region and neck space was likely secondary to tubercular infection.A split-thickness graft was applied in multiple fractions after three weeks of anti-tubercular chemotherapy.The patient had a long hospital stay due to the difficult location and complexity of the ulcer over the neck.He was followed up for six months in good clinical condition after discharge.', 'In January 2018, a 78-year-old man presented with complaints of numbness in the soles of both feet.There was no motor weakness on neurologic examination.Severe L4-5 central stenosis and root redundancy were diagnosed on lumbar MRI (Fig.', 'A 66-year-old male started to present symptoms of fever, dyspnea, coughing, asthenia, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.He was admitted to the acute care unit for observation and oxygen therapy, but his oxygen requirements constantly increased due to moderate ARDS.After 12 days of deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and proning with daily passive range of motion, the patient finally started to initiate active movements and was passively transferred to a chair.However, due to a persisting difficult weaning status, probably related to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed [ventilator settings: pressure support 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O].Subsequently, the patient showed significant improvement in his physical functions with active SOEB, chair-transfer with the help of 2 physical therapists, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes ().The strategy was to increase pressure support (by 5 cmH2O) during efforts to reinforce exercise training effects, unloading respiratory muscles.This strategy along with a highly collaborative patient culminated in his rapid improvement in physical function (MRC-SS 58/60, physical function ICU test score 10/12, walking distance 10 m), although he was still experiencing fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness (maximal inspiratory pressure of −45 cmH2O) and dysphagia upon his transfer to a step-down unit.', 'A 33-year-old female, gravida 2 para 1, was referred to our university hospital from a local medical clinic with a history of a positive serum beta-Human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level but no visible intrauterine gestational sac.Her laboratory findings were all normal except for the serum β-hCG, which was 146.762 mIU/mL.A gynecological examination revealed a closed cervical os and mild adnexal tenderness.The patient had regular 28-day menstrual cycles.Her first pregnancy had ended with a full-term delivery by caesarean section approximately nine years earlier.There was no history of cancer in her family.\\\\nA grayscale transabdominal ultrasound showed an empty uterine cavity, but a round hyperechoic lesion was identified in the anterior inferior wall of the uterus, measuring 23x32 mm in diameter (Figure ).There was no visible embryo or yolk sac within the lesion.The patient underwent careful dilatation and curettage (D&C) procedure, and the histopathological results were consistent with an ectopic molar pregnancy.The post-D&C period was uneventful, without excessive bleeding.The patient scheduled for methotrexate therapy, and the patient’s serum β-hCG level showed significant decrease.\\\\nThe β-hCG level that became available to us on the twenty-third day of the treatment was still as high as 15.947 mIU/mL, and it then rose again.Therefore, the patient underwent an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, which demonstrated a peripherally hyperintense and centrally hypointense lesion on coronal and sagittal T2-weighted images of the uterine CSS.', 'The patient was a 68-year-old female with a G3P2 (G, gravidity; P, parity) pregnancy history who had undergone a pancreatoduodenectomy of the pancreas to remove a tumor (adenocarcinoma) of the duodenal papillae at our hospital five years ago.She underwent computed tomography (CT) during the postoperative follow-up and was suspected of having an ovarian tumor (Figure ); thus, she visited our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.Transvaginal ultrasound showed a mass with abundant internal blood flow in the bladder mucosa (Figure ).Although the patient had no urinary tract symptoms, an examination by a urologist was deemed necessary.Accordingly, the patient was referred to the Department of Urology, and urinalysis and urine cytology were performed because early-stage bladder cancer was suspected.Urinalysis showed no hematuria, but urine cytology showed dysmorphic cells that were indicative of a tumor.Cystoscopy revealed a stalked papillary tumor at the apex of the posterior wall of the bladder.Transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed the following month.A 2-cm papillary tumor was found at the apex of the bladder (Figure ), and the lesion was resected, followed by intravesical chemotherapy administration.The pathological diagnosis revealed that the removed mass was a non-muscle-invasive bladder tumor (transitional cell carcinoma, stage 0a).At the three-month postoperative follow-up, no recurrence was noted.Postoperative CT examination has not yet been performed.', 'The patient is a 68-year-old retired male, born in Aloag and resident of Tambillo (a rural locality in the vicinity of the capital of Ecuador, Quito).His medical history was significant only for being a heavy smoker until 2016 (with a calculated 20 pack-year), copious alcohol consumption every 15 days until 2010 and a myocardial infarction in 2015, successfully treated with stenting, acetylsalicylic acid and atorvastatin, a medication that he continues until this day.There is no family history of cancer or other pathologies of interest.\\\\nIn February 2020, he presented dysesthesias in the right hemithorax associated with pain and a mass-like sensation in the same region.This prompted a visit to his local healthcare center (part of the public health network) where a chest CT scan was ordered in March 2020 revealing a solitary pulmonary mass located in the right inferior lobule with an invasion of both the pleura and thoracic wall.However, due to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador, all further studies were suspended for two to three months, resulting in a significant delay of the biopsy, which was undertaken on May 17, 2020.The histopathological study reported a neuroendocrine carcinoma.The patient was subjected to a thoracotomy and inferior pulmonary lobectomy on June 7, 2020 and was afterward treated with four cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and etoposide until November of the same year.In December, the patient presents with neurologic symptoms consisting of loss of balance, ataxic gait, headaches, and nausea, prompting the necessity of a brain MRI.', 'A three-year-old girl from Dhaka, previously healthy and thriving, weighing 16 Kg, was admitted to PICU with the complaint of five days of high continued fever with diffuse, central abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea for the last two days.She had experienced two episodes of melena and hematemesis.She had a history of contact with a COVID-19 positive patient in the last month but had no symptoms before the present illness.There was no previous history of dengue.She had been treated in another hospital for shock, and her dengue NS1 Ag was positive on the second day of fever.On admission, the patient was febrile, with narrow pulse pressure.Her blood pressure (BP) was 60/45 mmHg with tachycardia, she had tachypnea with a SpO2 of 90% by pulse oximeter in room air, a low volume pulse, and cold extremities.Auscultation of lungs revealed diminished breath sound with crepitations bilaterally.The abdomen was distended and tender.She was diagnosed with dengue shock syndrome with plasma leakage.She was treated with inotropes, IV furosemide, colloids, and levofloxacin.She was given 5L/min oxygen via a face mask.Her initial investigations revealed thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, positive C-reactive protein, mildly raised serum procalcitonin, altered liver function, and coagulopathy (as shown in Table ).Her CXR revealed bilateral pleural effusions with pneumonitis.Echocardiography showed prominent dilated coronaries, LMCA (+2.5 SD), LAD (+2.0 SD) with loss of distal tapering and perivascular brightness, bilateral pleural effusions, a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild LV dysfunction (EF 57%) (Figure ).\\\\nCardiac enzymes showed raised serum troponin I, NT-pro-BNP with raised serum ferritin and marked increased D-dimer level.The rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 Ag came back negative; however, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (IgG) was sent and came positive.By the sixth day of fever, the patient had conjunctival congestion and an erythematous rash on her trunk, which gradually faded (Figure ).\\\\nAfter consultation with cardiologists, one dose of IVIG 2g/Kg was given; thereafter, oral prednisolone and aspirin were added.Three days after the IVIG, repeat tests showed decreased serum troponin I and NT-pro-BNP.As her general condition had improved, the patient was transferred to the pediatric ward after seven days of PICU support.Thereafter she was discharged with advice and a follow-up appointment.', 'A 56-year-old woman, a mother of 3 children, presented to the surgical department with a history of multiple neck lumps of 4 months duration.She also had generalised vague abdominal pain, loss of appetite and lower back pain.She had no significant medical, family or psychosocial history.Clinical examination revealed multiple, bilateral enlarged cervical lymph nodes which were firm to hard in consistency.Thyroid examination revealed a 2 × 2 cm firm lump on the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe.Examination of other lymph node groups revealed enlarged right inguinal lymph nodes.Abdominal examination and rectal examination were normal.Vaginal examination revealed a hard, unhealthy uterine cervix.Breast and axillary examination were unremarkable.She had spinal tenderness, but the neurological examination of the lower limbs was normal.\\\\nHer basic blood investigations, liver profile and renal functions were within the normal limits.Ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed no abnormalities.Ultrasound scan of the neck revealed multiple nodules in the thyroid, with increased vascularity, and multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes with obliterated fatty hila suggestive of malignant deposits.Contrast enhanced computed tomography of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a mass in the uterine cervix (Fig.) with multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the inguinal, iliac, para-aortic, anterior mediastinal and bilateral deep cervical groups (Fig.).There were multiple low-density nodules in the thyroid gland (Fig.).A mixed density mass lesion was also noted in the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe (Fig.).Furthermore, an anterior wedge fracture of the L2 vertebra was seen, probably secondary to bone metastases.\\\\nBiopsies from the uterine cervix and endometrial curettage revealed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, signifying local extension of the cervical carcinoma into the endometrium (Fig.).Excision biopsy of a left cervical lymph node revealed metastatic deposits of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma similar to that of the uterine cervix (Fig.).Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of intra-thyroid nodules revealed malignant squamous cells (Fig.).This was followed by a panendoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract which yielded negative results.\\\\nA multidisciplinary meeting with the oncologists, surgeon, gynaecologists, pathologists and radiologists was conducted.Considering the histopathological and imaging findings with negative panendoscopy, a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix metastasising to the cervical lymph nodes and thyroid gland was made.A decision was made to commence palliative chemoradiotherapy.After 6 months, the patient developed generalised body oedema.She was transferred to a specialised cancer treatment centre for further palliative management, where she passed away a short while later, due to acute renal failure secondary to ureteric obstruction.', 'This is a case of a 4-year-old male who was brought to our clinic with complaints of four-day history of constipation, dry cough, vomiting, high fever (104 °F), abdominal pain with bloating, headache, and rash.The patient’s symptoms started gradually with fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle aches, cough, bloated abdomen, and poor oral intake, prior to presenting to the hospital.The parents assumed it was stomach flu, and so managed their child’s symptoms with Tylenol and soups.However, the patient continued to have constipation, abdominal discomfort, and eventually maculo-papular rashes on the head, face, and extremities erupted (Figure ).\\\\nOn day 1, upon admission to the hospital, IV fluid with 0.9% normal saline solution was started, due to signs of dehydration, bradycardia, and hypotension.Norepinephrine was also administered.Lab samples (stool, urine, and blood) were collected for analysis, and abdominal ultrasound was ordered which showed clumps of worms in the jejunum which explained the constipation our patient had (Figure ).\\\\nStool test for helminth (stained with bile) showed rounded 45-78 micrometer long thick-shelled eggs indicative of roundworm infestation (Ascaris lumbricoides).Blood test came back positive for typhoid DNA and increased level of eosinophils with relatively high leukocytes.The rest of the complete blood count (CBC) was normal including a chest X-ray.\\\\nFollowing day 2 of in-hospital admission, the patient’s condition remained unstable due to high fever (102 °F), vomiting, and fatigue.Antibiotics were initiated with ceftriaxone, antipyretics, albendazole, and more IV fluids.\\\\nFinally on day 3, the patient’s symptoms improved clinically, although body rashes persisted.CBC had normalized, and he was later discharged home with one week prescription of azithromycin and albendazole.The patient was also prescribed antihistamine cream to help stop the itching from the rash.', 'An 83-year-old female with a history of cold agglutinin hemolytic anemia requiring transfusions, chronic anemia with hemoglobin levels between 7-8 g/dl, hypothyroidism, hypertension, deep vein thrombosis in bilateral lower extremities, and chronic lymphedema, presented with shortness of breath, cough, weakness, lightheadedness, acrocyanosis or darkening of the fingers and toes (Figure ), jaundice, and darkening of her urine.She was found to have a productive cough with yellow sputum and worsening shortness of breath for the last four days, along with progressively worsening orthopnea that required sleeping upright.However, the patient denied chest pain, worsening leg swelling, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and wheezing.\\\\nOn presentation, the patient was afebrile, normotensive, with a normal heart rate, but had severe hypoxia with a saturation of 88% on room air and 95% with 2 liters of oxygen administered via nasal cannula.Throughout hospitalization, her temperature ranged between 96.7 and 98.6 °F (36-37 ℃).Physical examination was remarkable for mucosal pallor, acrocyanosis, icterus of the facial skin, diffuse bilateral rhonchi on lung auscultation, and pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities below the knee.Chest X-ray showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, perihilar vascular fullness, and bilateral interstitial prominence likely indicative of pulmonary vascular congestion.A cardiac echocardiogram found the ejection fraction to be 60-65% with mild left ventricular wall thickness and grade I diastolic dysfunction.However, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were only mildly elevated at 571 pg/mL.Moreover, nasal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive but was negative for influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus.\\\\nComplete blood count revealed a high white blood count of 26.8 thousand/uL (normal range: 4.0-10.8 thousand/uL), low hemoglobin of 5.8 g/dl (12.0-16.0 g/dL), low haptoglobin of 1 mg/dL (41-165 mg/dL), and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 110 mm/hr (0-29 mm/hr).Serum chemistry testing found hyperkalemia of 6.7 mEq/L (3.5-5.1 mEq/L), elevated blood urea nitrogen of 34 mg/dl (8-25 mg/dl) with normal creatinine of 0.6 mg/dl (0.6-1.3 mg/dl), and severely elevated total bilirubin of 10.8 mg/dL (0.1-1.4 mg/dL).Blood culture collected from two different sites revealed no growth.Direct Coombs test was positive, and direct Coombs C3D test was also found to be positive during this admission.Testing from prior admissions had determined a cold agglutinin titer of 1:512.Other relevant testing included negative findings on hepatitis B virus IgM core antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, and hepatitis C virus antibody.\\\\nTo treat the symptomatic anemia, the patient was transfused with two units of crossmatch least incompatible warmed blood on day one and one unit of the same on day two of admission.The SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was treated with oral remdesivir for five days and intravenous dexamethasone 6 mg for seven days.The patient was also given intravenous 40 mg furosemide for pulmonary congestion, and empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin for pneumonia for three days.Post-transfusions, the patient’s day-three hemoglobin was 10.2 g/dL, which dropped in the next few days but stabilized at her baseline of 7-8 g/dL by discharge on day 10.By day three, the patient’s hyperkalemia had improved without intervention; the furosemide was discontinued since the patient was euvolemic on examination, and the azithromycin and ceftriaxone were stopped due to low concern for concomitant bacterial pneumonia.The patient remained in stable condition in the designated isolation room through the rest of her hospital stay, and after 10 days since her initial positive coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) test, the isolation protocol was lifted.She reported feeling like she was “regaining her strength”.Yet, her oxygen levels persisted to desaturate with exertion and an ambulatory pulse oximetry examination revealed that she required 3 L of oxygen on discharge.The patient was recommended to be discharged to a sub-acute rehabilitation center.\\\\nTwo days post-discharge, the patient had another drop in her hemoglobin to 6.3 g/dL and required admission to a cancer institute where she was hospitalized for eight days, requiring five units of packed red blood cells and 60 mg of methylprednisolone IV daily.She had no signs and symptoms of bleeding during her admission.Her hemoglobin level improved to 9.2 g/dl and remained stable prior to discharge.On evaluation by an oncologist, weekly treatment with rituximab was recommended post-discharge for four weeks.On discharge, she was also prescribed prednisone 40 mg for seven days followed by a taper to 20 mg for another seven days and a follow-up appointment with oncology.', 'One week after a positive COVID-19 result this 57-year-old male was admitted to the ICU because of oxygen desaturation (70%) with worsening tachypnea and dyspnea.Physical therapy started immediately after ICU admission.We found a highly dyspneic patient with a high breathing frequency and significant symptom exacerbation from the slightest effort.With hands-on physical therapy guidance, the patient managed to achieve a 135° prone position and to perform deep-breathing exercises resulting in an increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%.Intensive physical therapy and positioning was continued along with 6 to 12 L/min of oxygen therapy over the next days and intubation was avoided.The major challenges in achieving a prone position were the patient’s profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and the high risk of exacerbating his symptoms.However, standard ICU monitoring enabled safe implementation at an individually adapted pace to allow sufficient time for convalescence.After 3 days with this regime, he could be transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists carried on his rehabilitation with walking and strength training.The patient’s severe instability remained a challenge.Nevertheless, 9 days after ICU admission, the patient was able to leave the hospital as a pedestrian.', 'A 61-year-old woman with confirmed COVID-19 was admitted to a different hospital with a productive cough experienced for a few days.She required invasive assisted ventilation shortly after admission.Her medical history included rheumatoid arthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, and arterial hypertension.Because of progressive severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the patient was transferred to our tertiary care hospital for kinetic therapy (prone positioning for at least 12 h per day) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI) (A).Because of progressive hypoxemia, venovenous ECMO therapy was initiated 13 days after admission to our hospital (A).Subsequently, nasopharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.After tracheotomy and weaning, ECMO therapy and invasive assisted ventilation were no longer required, but the patient still needed intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT) (A).\\\\nDuring the course of the disease, the patient developed laboratory signs of liver injury during ECMO therapy before the clinical appearance of jaundice with elevated bilirubin levels, but sustained synthetic liver function reflected by the international normalized ratio (INR) and serum albumin measurements (B–E).A diagnosis of SSC-CIP was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), showing intraductal filling defects in the intrahepatic bile ducts due to biliary casts.In addition, the patient received drugs that have previously been associated with SSC, including amoxicillin-clavulanate, and ketamine sedation [,,].Plasma levels of bilirubin and ammonia gradually increased after that, with stable liver synthesis reflected by normal values of the international normalized ratio (INR) without substituting coagulation factors (D,E).\\\\nNevertheless, the patient developed progressive nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion as the disease progressed.Hepatic encephalopathy was treated with lactulose and rifaximin, but clinical symptoms worsened (A).Based on these observations, hemadsorption using the CytoSorb hemoperfusion device (CytoSorbents Europe, Berlin, Germany) was used in combination with IRRT (6 treatments within 7 days and 8–12 h per session).In this patient with SSC following ECMO therapy and severe COVID-19, hemadsorption successfully eliminated bilirubin, ammonia, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, while serum albumin levels remained stable (A).Direct comparison revealed that bilirubin was less efficiently eliminated by hemadsorption by 33% and 56% after 2 and 6 treatments, respectively (B) compared to ammonia by 65% and 74% after 2 and 6 treatments, respectively (C).During successful elimination of bilirubin and ammonia, clinical symptoms of nausea, vomiting, weakness, and exhaustion improved.Following a continuation of IRRT but termination of hemadsorption therapy, bilirubin (32.2 mg/dL) and ammonia levels (208 g/dL) increased again, worsening clinical symptoms within 20 days.The patient suddenly died due to cardiac arrhythmia before liver transplantation evaluation was initiated.', 'A 23-year-old man was admitted to our cardiomyopathy clinic for repetitive ventricular ectopic beats.He was hemodynamically stable with no other relevant symptoms.He never experienced syncope and was unaware of any case of cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death in his family.Remarkably, his medical history included an episode of acute myocarditis one year before.At that time, he was admitted to the emergency department of a different hospital with chest pain, troponin rise, and T wave inversion in the inferolateral leads on ECG ().An urgent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries.Then, a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed, showing a non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with low-normal ejection fraction (EF), as well as normal RV dimensions and function.T2-weighted images highlighted the presence of mid-wall myocardial edema involving the interventricular septum, where mid-wall late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was also noted on post-contrast images ().Endomyocardial biopsy was proposed, though the patient did not provide informed consent.The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of acute myocarditis, with a recommendation for close clinical follow-up.When re-assessing the patients at his 1-year follow-up, echocardiography showed an initial reduction of LV EF, with an area of hypo-akinesia involving the lateral wall, and preserved RV dimensions and function.A new CMR study was performed, which confirmed the mildly reduced LV EF with no evidence of myocardial edema.Post-contrast images, however, revealed a diffuse circumferential subepicardial LGE involvement of the LV myocardium ().\\\\nTo exclude a left-dominant variant of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, in which this LGE pattern has been reported with CMR, genetic testing and accurate family screening were then performed.His 56-year-old mother and 30-year-old sister, both asymptomatic, were also found to have inverted T waves in the inferolateral leads on ECG and a mildly reduced LV EF on echocardiogram.Performing CMR on those two subjects, a pattern of LGE very similar to the one detected in the proband was detected ().No relevant clinical findings were identified by exploring the paternal side of the family.To our knowledge, this was the only documented case of a “myocarditis-like” onset of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy among the family members.\\\\nMolecular testing was carried out by analyzing a panel of target genes through an NGS-based procedure.The MAF threshold was set to 5% using Illumina Variant Interpreter Software.Genetic testing identified a heterozygous variant in DSP (c.5428C>T, p.Gln1810Ter).\\\\nAccording to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), the variant was classified as likely pathogenic (class IV).\\\\nThe same mutation was found in the patient’s relatives with a positive phenotype (), and a diagnosis of familiar left-dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy was finally made.The patient, as well as his mother and sister, started therapy with β-blocker drugs, and the proband also received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.', 'A 54-year-old Japanese woman was transferred to Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan, for persistent fever with chest imaging abnormalities.She had a smoking history of 30 pack years.She had been diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer and had been treated with chemoradiotherapy five years earlier.Two years prior to this clinical presentation, the patient had an established diagnosis of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM), with neurological findings of neurogenic bladder, orthostatic hypotension, bilateral lower limb spasticity, increased deep tendon reflexes, and positive bilateral Babinski reflexes, as well as positive serum and cerebrospinal fluid tests for anti-HTLV-1 antibodies.\\\\nPost diagnosis of HAM, the patient experienced recurrent episodes of aspiration pneumonia and had a gastrostomy placed a year and a half earlier.A year earlier, she developed acute progressive HTLV-1-related myelopathy of bilateral lower limbs and was treated with methylprednisolone 1000mg pulse therapy, followed by 5mg of prednisone maintenance therapy at Fukuoka Central Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.In the outpatient clinic at Fukuoka Central Hospital, she presented a fever with mild sputum.Her chest computed tomography (CT) showed infiltration in the upper right lobe and she was diagnosed with pneumonia.Despite treatment with levofloxacin for five days, a high fever persisted, and she was admitted to Fukuoka Central Hospital.\\\\nAt Fukuoka Central Hospital, she was placed on total parenteral nutrition, suspected of aspiration pneumonia, and was treated with tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), followed by meropenem (MEPM) and vancomycin (VCM).She was also suspected to have vasculitis from the findings of purpura on her both lower limbs, and the corticosteroid dose was temporarily increased.Despite this effort of examinations and treatment for one month, her fever, high levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and chest imaging abnormalities persisted.She was then transferred to Hamanomachi Hospital for further investigation and treatment on hospital day 28 (Figure ).\\\\nOn admission to Hamanomachi Hospital, she was sarcopenic with a body mass index of 13.5. She had muscle weakness of manual muscle testing (MMT) of 2-3/5, mainly in her lower limbs, which were the same levels of her baseline.Her respiratory condition was normal, with a respiratory rate of 15/min and SpO2 98% on room air.Crackles were not detected in her chest.Persistent, increased levels of CRP (7.7 mg/dL) and a white blood cell count of 6400 /μL were noted (Figure ).Chest x-ray imaging showed a giant air-space in the right upper lung field one year earlier (Figure , panel A).Consolidation was found in the right upper lung field on admission to Hamanomachi Hospital (Figure , panel B).Chest CT imaging showed dense consolidation with an air bronchogram and a giant bulla with fluid retention in the right upper lobe, as well as an emphysematous change in the bilateral lungs (Figure , panel A).Given the clinical course at Fukuoka Central Hospital and examination results on admission to Hamanomachi Hospital, a refractory lung abscess and an infected bulla were suspected.Suspected pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which were detected by sputum culture at Fukuoka Central Hospital.The differential diagnoses were opportunistic infections such as aspergillosis, mycobacteriosis, vasculitis, HTLV-1-associated bronchioalveolitis, and adult T-cell leukemia infiltration.\\\\nTo confirm the diagnosis, a bronchoscopy was performed on hospital day 30 (Figure ).Transbronchial lung biopsies (TBLB), bronchial brushing, and bronchial washing were conducted from the right B2 bronchus.Bacterial culture from bronchial washing was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA, consistent with the sputum culture at Fukuoka Central Hospital and on admission to Hamanomachi Hospital.Neither Aspergillus species nor Mycobacterium species was detected.Hematoxylin and eosin staining of TBLB showed bronchial tissues with mild to moderate chronic inflammation and lymphocyte-predominant infiltration (Figure , panels A-C).Infiltrating lymphocytes were small and showed no morphological abnormalities.A small number of neutrophils and plasma cells were also seen.No findings suggestive of malignancy or adult T-cell lymphoma were noted.Infiltrating lymphocytes were a mixture of cluster of differentiation (CD)20-positive B lymphocytes and CD3-positive T lymphocytes (Figure , panel D), with a slight predominance of B lymphocytes.CD8-positive T lymphocytes were predominant among T lymphocytes (Figure , panels E and F).The pathological meaning is explained in the Discussion section.\\\\nBased on these results, the patient was initiated with antibiotics (MEPM and VCM, followed by ceftazidime and linezolid).She was also treated with 5 g/day of intravenous immunoglobulin for three days, considering her immunosuppressive condition.However, she remained febrile with the upward trend of CRP.Considering the refractory state of the infected lung bulla, we performed percutaneous ultrasound-guided drainage of the bulla on day 38, following daily washing using sterile saline (Figure , panel C and Figure , panel B).The fluid from the drain was reddish-brown and cloudy, and Aspergillus species were detected in the drainage culture (Figure ).Given the pulmonary aspergillosis in addition to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA infection, voriconazole was initiated on day 49, although beta-D-glucan (14.3 pg/mL) and galactomannan (0.1 index) were negative.\\\\nDuring treatment, we had to change antibiotics several times because of the drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (carbapenem and quinolone resistance with moderate cephem resistance) and the side effects of the antibiotics.Amikacin was used for the combination treatment of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa from day 60.Complications arising from anti-MRSA drugs included serum AST/ALT elevation caused by VCM, pancytopenia triggered by linezolid, and serum creatine kinase (CK) elevation (>1000 U/L) in response to daptomycin (Figure ).\\\\nPrednisolone was gradually reduced and discontinued in consideration of its adverse effect on refractory infections.On approximately day 70, she gradually developed polyarthritis in her knees, right shoulder, and both wrist joints.Serological examination revealed elevation of rheumatoid factor (59.7 IU/L), but no elevation of anti-CCP antibodies (0.8 U/mL).Joint ultrasound showed active synovitis in both hand joints.The differential diagnosis of her poly-arthritis was antibiotic use-related arthritis, sepsis-related arthritis, pseudogout crystal arthropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, and HTLV-1-associated arthritis.She was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Corticosteroids or other immunomodulating drugs could not be used until the infected bulla and lung abscess were completely healed.Her poly-arthritis persisted several months after the transfer to Fukuoka Central Hospital.From these results and clinical course, she was considered to have rheumatoid arthritis or HTLV-1-associated arthritis, which had been suppressed by the corticosteroid treatment.\\\\nThereafter, the fever gradually resolved, and the inflammatory response trended downwards.Chest imaging showed improvement of infiltration and reduction of the size of the infected bulla (Figure , panel D and Figure , panel C).We removed the drain tube on day 87.Her general condition improved, and she was transferred to Fukuoka Central Hospital on day 94.She was discharged to her home on day 150.No relapse of the infection has been observed since the discontinuation of antibiotics.', 'The patient, a 32-year-old Caucasian woman, presented to the West Virginia University Hospital Emergency Department via Emergency Medical Services.The patient had been at her usual baseline state of health with no significant past medical history prior to visiting the chiropractor for neck adjustment earlier that day for tension like soreness.The patient underwent neck manipulation after which she immediately complained of neck pain, diaphoresis, and proceeded to experience cardiac and respiratory arrest.Emergency Medical Services was called, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed with one round of epinephrine administered.It was reported that the patient was pulseless and apneic for 3 minutes prior to EMS arrival.The patient was intubated on transport and her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3T prior to arrival.Mean arterial blood pressure was 80 with palpable femoral pulses at arrival to the emergency department.Upon arrival in the emergency department, a CT stroke protocol was performed which demonstrated bilateral severe distal cervical vertebral artery dissections with acute thrombotic emboli seen in the left cervical vertebral artery ( and ).This was accompanied by complete occlusion of the basilar tip including the proximal posterior cervical arteries.\\\\nThe patient received an initial bolus of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) at this time and the decision was made to proceed with endovascular intervention given the recent onset of occlusion.The patient was brought to the neurovascular angiography suite and femoral access obtained.Angiography of the left vertebral artery demonstrated severe dissection involving the distal cervical vertebral artery segments at the C1-C2 level with presence of sub occlusive thrombi.There was an occlusive clot in the left Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA).Intracranial imaging demonstrated occlusion at the basilar apex with absent filling into the right Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA).There was occlusion of the distal left PCA.Angiography of the right vertebral artery demonstrated severe dissection of the distal cervical vertebral artery at C1-C2 with the presence of trickle-like flow into the vertebrobasilar junction.No filling was observed in the right PICA territory ().At this point, it was decided that the left vertebral artery offered the best access to the basilar trunk.\\\\nSubsequently, distal aspiration was begun with a Penumbra 5 Max ACE distal aspiration catheter which initially demonstrated slow flow through the suction tubing.The 5 Max ACE was withdrawn into the proximal basilar artery until flow was seen within the suction tubing.Repeat angiography at this time demonstrated recanalization of the basilar apex and proximal PCAs. TICI3 perfusion was seen in the right PCA.Occlusive clot remained in the left distal P2 segment.Given the large size of the PCA, timing of events, and patient’s age, the decision was made to attempt clot retrieval of this.At this time, the Trevo ProVue microcatheter was navigated into the left distal PCA distal to the clot.The Trevo 4 mm × 30 mm stent retriever was deployed for approximately 3 minutes.The suction canister was attached, and the stent retriever was pulled with distal aspiration.No significant recanalization was achieved with what amounted to TICI0 perfusion to the left PCA territory.No further attempts were made as it was believed that the left PCA territory had completed its infarction.\\\\nFollowing completion of endovascular therapy, the patient was taken for immediate MRI Brain with and without contrast for assessment of brainstem integrity and cerebrovascular status prior to transport to the intensive care unit.', 'A 60-year-old man who presented with a recent history of impaired vision of right eye for about 3 months due to brain lesions.He was diagnosed with liver cancer and underwent surgery three months ago.The pathological result is hepatocellular carcinoma.His right eye showed impaired vision and the proton MRI revealed brain metastasis located in the right orbital part (Figure ).\\\\nThe patient was not suitable for the surgical excision due to his poor physical conditions after liver tumor resection.', 'This 52-year-old male tested COVID-19 positive 4 days after the beginning of a dry cough, fever, and head and limb pain.One day later, he was hospitalized with exertional dyspnea.He was diagnosed with pneumonia that developed into moderate ARDS needing mechanical ventilation and intermittent dialysis.After extubation, oxygenation was stable with 2 to 3 L/min of oxygen.However, the patient was disoriented and could not communicate verbally.His global weakness (CPAx 11/50) was accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia.Spontaneous swallowing frequency and tongue control were severely reduced, and the patient showed insufficient protection from aspiration.This was confirmed by a specialized physical therapist with the Gugging Swallowing Screen, which confirmed severe dysphagia with 2/20 points.He was treated nil by mouth and received dysphagia therapy such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and training of protection mechanisms.After initial agitation and disorientation, the patient started to communicate in single-word phrases, but dysphagia continued to be severe with massive oral and pharyngeal dry saliva residuals that compromised his paresthesia and required regular mouth care.Over the next days, the patient managed to swallow pureéd food and mildly thick fluids under supervision, although cough strength was still weak (Gugging Swallowing Screen 13/20, CPAx 30/50).Nevertheless, he continued to progress and became capable of independent food ingestion (Gugging Swallowing Screen 20/20, CPAx 39/50) before his discharge to a rehabilitation clinic 25 days after admission.', 'Patient 2: A 43-year-old woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage, classified as Fisher I, Hunt, and Hess II.In the digital 3D angiographic reconstruction multiple aneurysms are observed: a right M1 aneurysm and a right superior carotid-ophthalmic aneurysm ().', 'A previously healthy 12-year-old girl from Dhaka, weighing 55 Kg, was admitted with a four-day history of high intermittent fever, headache, arthralgia, and generalized body aches.She had an erythematous rash on her trunk, cough, and respiratory distress.She was initially admitted to another hospital, but her condition deteriorated, and she developed shock and was referred to our PICU.She had complained of flu-like symptoms within two weeks of the presenting illness.She had a history of one episode of dengue fever three years earlier but no contact history with a COVID-19 patient.\\\\nOn admission, the patient was conscious, febrile (temperature 104°F), tachypneic, tachycardic with unrecordable blood pressure, and prolonged capillary refill time.SpO2 by pulse oximeter was 93% in room air and 96% with 2L/min oxygen via nasal cannula.Auscultation of lungs revealed bilateral diminished air entry with coarse crepitations, pleural rub.The abdomen was distended, full flanks with diffuse mild tenderness.She tested dengue NS1 Ag positive on the second day of fever.Management for dengue shock syndrome with plasma leakage was initiated with inotropes, IV furosemide, and albumin along with IV ceftriaxone and amikacin.She was given oxygen 3L/min via a face mask.The initial investigations showed thrombocytopenia, mild hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, positive C-reactive protein, altered liver function tests with coagulopathy (as given in Table ).Her chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions with pneumonitis (Figure ).\\\\nA bedside echocardiogram revealed a prominent LMCA (+2.54 SD), minimal pericardial effusion, mild pleural effusion, and good biventricular function (EF 77%).Her NT-pro-BNP, serum ferritin, D-dimer were significantly high but serum troponin I was normal.At this time, the patient had mucocutaneous involvement with respiratory symptoms.Her anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG came back positive.After reviewing the laboratory reports and echocardiographic features, we consulted the pediatric cardiologist.She was treated with one dose of IVIG 2g/Kg and started on oral prednisolone and aspirin.The patient was transferred to the main ward when she began to show clinical and laboratory improvements.She was soon discharged with the necessary advice and follow-up arrangements.', \"The patient was a 48-year-old male who had been undergoing regular dilatations for the last 8 years for sustaining relief from his urethral stricture.He had a history of having undergone open suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) 8 years ago for acute urinary retention secondary to recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI).He developed surgical site infection (SSI) postoperatively which was managed conservatively.The stricture had been managed with internal optic urethrotomy (IOU) and serial dilatations, following which the patient started doing well with 6 monthly dilatations.\\\\nSince last 2 years, he developed a swelling in the right inguinoscrotal region associated with repeated thinning of urinary stream and recurrent episodes of burning micturition.The swelling became static and persistent in the last 2 months.\\\\nOn examination, there was a 5-cm long vertical midline scar in the suprapubic region.An irreducible soft swelling of 8 cm × 6 cm was present in the right inguinal region which extended up to the base of scrotum.Cough impulse was present, and we could not get above the swelling.The defect could not be localized.There was also a gradual growing difficulty in negotiating urethral dilators due to the path distortion by the contents of the hernia.Cystoscopy revealed narrowing in bulbar urethra with deviations in the proximal anterior urethra and the scope needed to be negotiated to reach the urinary bladder.Ultrasound showed findings consistent with right inguinal omentocele and a scarred suprapubic region.Defect could not be localized.\\\\nThe patient had been coaxed for surgery multiple times but he did not agree due to poor past surgical experience.He eventually landed with difficulty in micturition and inability to get dilators passed.A preoperative diagnosis of right sided, complete, irreducible, inguinal omentocele with urethral stricture was made, and the patient was planned for right open hernioplasty with cystourethroscopy along with IOU.\\\\nIntraoperatively, a right indirect hernial sac with omentum as content was found; the sac was opened, omentum resected, and sac was transfixed at its neck followed by posterior wall strengthening.Another hernial sac with omentum as content was found in midline beneath the scar of old SPC which was densely adherent to the surrounding fibrotic tissue (\\\\n).This sac was dissected out, opened, content resected, and sac was closed.For the right inguinal hernia, a mesh hernioplasty was done.After the closure of the external oblique aponeurosis, anatomical repair of midline defect was achieved and strengthening was done with overlay mesh covering the midline defect.On cystourethroscopy, a stricture was present from posterior part of penile urethra to bulbar urethra.IOU was done and 18-Fr Foley's catheter left in situ.\\\\nA postoperative diagnosis of right-sided, complete, irreducible, indirect inguinal hernia, and incisional hernia with omentum as contents with urethral stricture was made.The patient developed SSI on post operative day (POD)-2 which was managed by wound irrigation and oral antibiotics.\\\\nAt follow-up after 1 month, a repeat cystourethroscopy was performed which showed fibrosis and narrowing at the site of IOU.A repeat IOU was done.The anterior urethra had straightened out and dilatation was simple and smooth.The patient now has a good urinary stream, no complaint of restriction in passage and dilatations have become a smooth affair.The patient has been on 4 monthly dilatation for the past year which have all been smooth and has now been called after 6 months for next follow-up.\", 'A 55-year-old female patient consulted the neurologist because of vertigo and tinnitus.Clinical examination revealed an obvious palatal myoclonus.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, and T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed focal hyperintensity and expansion of both medullary olives (Figure ).', 'Paramedics found this 59-year-old female with dyspnea and an oxygenation of 65% on room air and performed immediate tracheal intubation.Moderate ARDS with reduced lung compliance was diagnosed and treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and prone positioning.\\\\nOn day 14, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, while she was still intubated and under pressure support ventilation.SOEB required 3 physical therapists to maintain the position, but resulted in a significant increase in her level of consciousness and collaborative state.The next day, she was able to hold her head and sit for about 15 minutes with 2 therapists.Her muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) of 40/60; still she continued with small but consistent improvements and started to participate actively in physical therapy sessions.She was encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity and was actively transferred to a chair each day with the help of 2 physical therapists.She was successfully extubated, but presented postextubation dysphagia.The physical therapy team closely monitored her for secretion management and cough stimulation and continued her physical rehabilitation.On day 19, she started to walk with a walking aid, although at this point oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident (89% with 3 L/min of oxygen).After 25 days, she was transferred to the institution’s rehabilitation facilities, where a battery of tests indicated persistent physical function impairment (MRC-SS 52/60, physical function ICU test score17 9/12, Timed Up & Go 23 seconds, short physical performance battery 4/12).', \"A 73-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident with a right-sided deficit and speech deficit presented in a somnolent state to the emergency room.The patient reportedly had generalized body aches, dyspnea, and cough, which had been progressively worsening over the past two to three days.The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.\\\\nThe patient experienced a prolonged hospital course, remaining in the hospital for approximately three months.A brief overview of the first month of hospitalization is given as follows: the patient was started on dexamethasone, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone at admission.His condition was complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed requiring multiple blood transfusions and a pulmonary embolism.The pulmonary embolism could not be adequately treated with anticoagulation due to his gastrointestinal bleed.His respiratory status declined, due to COVID-19, necessitating intubation which the patient required for most of his hospital stay.Broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued for the majority of his hospital course, switching to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia.The patient required two courses of triple antibiotic therapy to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia due to persistent leukocytosis and a chest X-ray significant for signs of infiltrates which remained following his initial treatment course for ventilator-associated pneumonia.\\\\nDuring the second month of his hospital stay, after his initial antibiotics courses had been completed, due to worsening respiratory status, sputum cultures were performed on hospital day (HD) # 26 which revealed Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Citrobacter koseri, which were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ().Due to his gastrointestinal bleed, the patient underwent an esophagoduodenoscopy and a colonoscopy.Esophagoduodenoscopy revealed mild antral gastritis with a deformed duodenal bulb as well as some mild diverticulosis.Colonoscopy revealed a large ascending-colon mass.Two biopsy samples were taken of this colon mass, which returned consistent with tubular adenoma without cytologic atypia.However, it was suggested by the pathologist that if this biopsy material was part of a larger lesion, a more advanced malignant lesion could not be excluded.The patient was too unstable during his hospitalization to undergo resection of the mass.On HD # 38, the patient received a tracheostomy which he tolerated well without complications.On HD # 49, the patient experienced a febrile episode (maximum temperature of 101.2 °F).At this time, the patient had both a Foley catheter and an internal jugular central line in place (he required both of these for the majority of his hospital course).Urinalysis, urine cultures, blood cultures, and a chest X-ray were ordered on the same day ().Urinalysis revealed 38 red blood cells per High Powered Field (HPF), 13 white blood cells/HPF, 2+ bacteria, many budding yeast, and 3+ hyaline casts ().Due to the bacteria and yeast in his urine, the Foley catheter was replaced the same day.Leukocytosis was only mild (10.6 cells per cubic millimeter of blood), but continued to increase to 15 cells per cubic millimeter of blood over the ensuing four days ().The urine culture that resulted on HD # 53 revealed T.asahii.Isolates of T.asahii were obtained by performing a culture on a TSA blood agar plate with 5% sheep blood.The isolates were incubated at 35°C in an incubator at an ambient atmosphere for 24 hours.Isolates were identified using the VITEK 2 system (bioMérieux, Inc., Hazelwood, MO).Although the urinalysis had shown 2+ bacteria, no bacterial growth was seen in the urine culture.Blood culture revealed no growth after five days.Serum beta-D glucan was negative.The urine culture was sent to an outside laboratory (Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, Chantilly, VA) to determine sensitivities.\\\\nAt Quest Diagnostics, the isolates were reincubated on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) overnight.The inoculum was prepared in sterile demineralized water and standardized to a 0.5 McFarland.Twenty microliters of the suspension was added to a tube with 11 mL of Sensititre YeastOne Inoculum Broth and then prepared by inoculating 100 uL per well.In vitro advanced fungal susceptibility testing was performed using anidulafungin, micafungin, caspofungin, 5-flucytosine, posaconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, and amphotericin B.Trichosporon organisms were tested with these agents using broth microdilution according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).The stock solutions purchased by Quest Diagnostics are prediluted (information regarding dilution preparation is not available).Isolates were identified using the Sensititre Trek YeastOne panel (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Cat.No. YO-9), which is a broth microdilution panel.The manufacturer's instructions were followed for setting up, reading, and analyzing the assay.Plates were incubated at 33–35°C for 24 hours minimum.The Sensititre system monitors for colorimetric change.MIC values were determined by demonstrating the lowest concentration of drug that does not demonstrate a color change.CLSI document M27 was used for the interpretation of results.\\\\nPending sensitivity results, a repeat urine culture was ordered (HD # 53).On HD # 58, the patient again experienced a febrile episode, with a maximum temperature of 103.0°F accompanied by a leukocyte increase from 10 to 15 cells per cubic millimeter of blood ().On HD # 58, the repeat urine culture results confirmed the presence of T.asahii.Again, no bacterial growth was seen in the urine culture.Antifungal medication had not been started initially as there was concern that the initial urine culture obtained on HD # 49 had revealed a contaminant or was reflective of asymptomatic colonization.However, with the repeat urine culture revealing T.asahii, the febrile episode, and leukocyte increase despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal coverage was deemed necessary.The patient was started on empiric fluconazole on HD # 58, and his Foley catheter was again replaced that same day ().A tracheal aspirate culture was ordered which returned results on HD # 63 revealing Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was again started ().On HD# 65, the sensitivities for the urine culture (sent to an outside laboratory on HD # 52) returned which revealed nonsusceptibility to fluconazole (MIC 2 mcg/mL), resistance to caspofungin and micafungin (MIC > 8 mcg/mL), and sensitivity to voriconazole (MIC 0.03 mcg/mL).Based on the advanced fungal testing, voriconazole was started on HD # 65 (following seven days of fluconazole) per infectious disease recommendations and continued for seven days ().The patient had remained afebrile with improved leukocytosis since starting fluconazole (white blood cell count decreased from 15 cells per cubic millimeter of blood to 9 cells per cubic millimeter of blood).With the initiation of the voriconazole, the leukocyte count continued to drop to normal levels (4.40 cells per cubic millimeter of blood).\\\\nA percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed on HD # 78, and the patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.Urine cultures were obtained on HD # 78 and revealed 10,000 CFU/mL of usual skin flora.T.asahii was no longer present in urine ().At this point, the patient was accepted and transferred to a long-term care facility on HD # 80.At this long-term care facility, multiple attempts failed to fit the patient with an aerosolized tracheostomy collar.A decision was made to initiate palliative care.On HD # 44 at the long-term care facility, he was found without spontaneous respirations or palpable pulse.\", 'Patient XY, a 44-year-old female presented to the ED with vomiting following consumption of locally foraged mushrooms.An experienced forager, the patient had collected and prepared the mushrooms for dinner.Between six to eight hours later, the patient noted abdominal pain and associated vomiting.The vomitus was bilious in nature with multiple episodes occurring over the next two to three hours.With persistent vomiting, she called an ambulance that brought her to her local hospital.Admission and investigation found a deranged liver profile, and the diagnosis of acute liver failure secondary to the fungi consumption was made.Ms. XY was transferred to the National Liver Unit where she underwent orthotopic liver transplant.Following a tumultuous post-operative course including an ICU admission, and Hepatic, Renal, Plastics, Rheumatology and Dermatology input, an incidental finding on CT of the abdomen/pelvis foreshadowed the orthopaedic trajectory of our patient.\\\\nFollowing discharge from the ICU, the patient began recovery on the ward.At this point, her primary concern was painful discolouration at the pulps of her fingers and toes.Painful lesions were also noted in the right flank region.Dermatology input resulted in a diagnosis of skin necrosis post-transplant with microvascular thrombosis of the hands and feet.Skin graft to the right flank region was performed by the Plastics team.The post-operative period was once again complicated by sepsis and treated with antibiotics.She remained on a prolonged course of steroids for up to six months post-operatively.\\\\nAs XY continued to improve clinically, her recovery was aided by our multi-disciplinary team input.Throughout this period, the patient noted a new onset of groin pain resulting in regression in her mobility.In the proceeding four weeks, Ms. XY continued to suffer from pain, impeding her progress with physiotherapy.A physical exam now revealed a swollen and erythematous knee, with a reduced range of motion.An X-ray excluded knee pathology including joint effusion and fracture and confirmed normal alignment, as shown in Figure and Figure .The Pain team now became involved and recommended increased medication doses and frequency.\\\\nXY’s pain continued to increase over the subsequent six weeks and she was unable to engage fully in physiotherapy for six months.XY described the pain as sharp, without radiation and aggravated by movement.A physical exam revealed an oedematous swollen joint surrounding the cruciate ligament.An MRI was conducted as suggested by the pain team to investigate the integrity of the surrounding soft tissues.', 'An 18-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with right hip pain for two weeks.Examination revealed pain and mild to moderate tenderness in the right hip joint.The range of motion was decreased, and trying to initiate movement caused severe pain to the extent that the patient could not walk for gait assessment.Past history revealed similar but less severe episodes for the last four years.There was no history of fever, skin rash, or acne.His inflammatory laboratory investigations, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), were within the normal limits.X-rays of the pelvis and right thigh were unremarkable except for a small lucency in the right greater trochanteric region (Figure ).\\\\nSubsequently, an MRI of the right thigh showed trochanteric bursa effusion and right hip joint synovitis (Figures , ).\\\\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol were started for the management, and the patient showed excellent improvement for the first three months.\\\\nHe remained well for four months, after which he developed swelling of the right sternoclavicular joint.', 'Case 2 was a male child aged 8 years and 7 months.He visited the hospital with a chief complaint of pain in the anterior maxilla following exposure to cold water.He had a history of trauma to the anterior primary teeth at the age of one year, with composite resin repair of a fracture in the crown of the upper right primary central incisor.There was no past medical history.An abnormal position of the upper right permanent central incisor and clouding of the labial surface were observed, which were likely due to trauma to the primary teeth ().Examination results indicated a VAS value of 6 for cold water and 7.5 for air blowing.Immediately after treatment, the patient no longer felt pain with air or cold water, VAS was zero.One month later, the VAS was 4 by cold water and 5 by air.The treatment was reapplied once monthly.The hypersensitivity had become acceptable to the patient and VAS was 2 after fourth treatment.During the seven treatments, the pain did not completely disappear, the VAS by cold water was 1–2, whereas the VAS by air was 2–4.While extensive clouding remained, the color tone was obscured and improved ().During the process of this treatment, discolored devitalized teeth, gingival inflammation and percussion pain did not appear.Digital analysis showed significantly reduced cloudiness from 27,886 pixels to 7904 pixels ().The hypomineralized tooth was mostly cloudy, with a narrow area with a brown color.However, this area significantly decreased after treatment (p < 0.03).This result indicated that not only strong cloudiness but also slight brown color were significantly improved.', 'An 18-year-old female who was 10 days post-vaginal delivery presented to the ED in status epilepticus for which she required endotracheal intubation.She had a blood pressure of 163/89 millimeters of mercury, a heart rate of 155 beats per minute, a temperature of 37.0°Celsius, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on 15L per minute of oxygen via a bag-valve mask.Physical examination confirmed the presence of left leg swelling with mild erythema below the knee; otherwise, no palpable cords or other abnormalities were seen in her lower extremities.Initially it was thought to be deep venous thrombosis, but there was no evidence via venous Doppler ultrasound.Cardiac examination did not reveal murmurs, rubs, gallops, or other abnormalities, and her lungs were clear to auscultation.Upon questioning her family, it was revealed that a few hours prior to presentation the patient had developed sudden onset of difficulty breathing and subsequent loss of consciousness.She was rushed to the ED.\\\\nFurther workup revealed leukocytosis of 19.84×109 /L, elevated D-dimer of 19.9 milligrams per liter, fibrinogen of 457.9 milligrams per deciliter, and troponin of 2.42 micrograms per liter.An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed an S1Q3T3 pattern.A urine dipstick revealed +2 protein and was otherwise normal.\\\\nA magnesium sulfate (MGSO4) bolus dose of 4g intravenous (IV) over 30 minutes followed by a drip of 2 grams per hour was initiated for presumed eclampsia.A brain computed tomography (CT) without contrast was ordered for the workup of a first-time seizure.This was unremarkable.At this point, the patient’s differential diagnosis was reconsidered and prompted the team to order a CT venogram (CTV) of the brain with a CT pulmonary angiogram.It demonstrated CVT involving the superior sagittal and right transverse sinuses (), while her CT pulmonary angiogram showed bilateral pulmonary thromboses involving the main, lobar, and multiple segmental arteries bilaterally ().\\\\nEnoxaparin sodium was initiated in the ED and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.During her ICU stay, brain MRI with a magnetic resonance angiogram showed diffuse ischemia with a 5 mm tonsillar herniation and the absence of signal flow void in both internal carotid arteries ().', 'We present the case of a 42-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with a complaint of abdominal pain and diarrhea for 3 days.The abdominal pain started in the periumbilical region and was shifted to the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.The pain started gradually and had been progressing in severity.He described the pain as a stabbing in nature.It was exacerbated by movement and food intake.The pain was partially relieved by oral analgesic medications like paracetamol.The pain was associated with low-grade fever and decreased appetite.The patient also complained of diarrhea with five bowel motions/day.The stools were watery with no mucus or blood.He reported that diarrhea developed after he received an oral antibiotic therapy (cefuroxime) for a recent upper respiratory tract infection.\\\\nThe past medical history of the patient was remarkable for diabetes mellitus that was well-controlled with oral antidiabetic agents.He did not undergo any previous abdominal surgeries.He had a smoking history of 15 pack-years.He had never drunk alcohol before.He worked as a taxi driver.The family history was unremarkable for any inherited gastrointestinal disorders.\\\\nUpon examination, the patient appeared sick.He was not pale, jaundiced, or cyanosed.Vital signs revealed tachycardia (115 bpm), low-grade fever (37.5℃), normal respiratory rate (14 bpm), and maintained blood pressure (122/80 mmHg).The oxygen saturation was 99% on room air.Abdominal examination revealed a soft abdomen with diffuse tenderness.However, the tenderness was more pronounced in the right iliac fossa with a positive rebound sign.Further, the Rovsing sign was positive.Initial laboratory investigation revealed elevated leukocyte count and elevated inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein.The renal and hepatic profiles were within the normal limits (Table ).\\\\nIn light of the aforementioned clinical information, the patient was diagnosed as having acute appendicitis.A CT scan with intravenous contrast was performed to confirm the diagnosis.The scan demonstrated colonic wall thickening with edematous haustral folds suggestive of pseudomembranous colitis.Further, an endoluminal lesion was observed in the cecum with an average size of 6 cm.The lesion was well-defined and had a homogenous fat density with no solid component.The mass was causing a partial colonic obstruction.Such findings conferred the diagnosis of cecal lipoma (Figure ).\\\\nThe patient was prepared for an emergency laparoscopy for further evaluation and management.The operation was done under general anesthesia and the patient was placed in the supine position.Limited segmental rection of the cecum with appendectomy was performed.The estimated blood loss was 10 mL and the total operative time was 100 minutes.The patient tolerated the operation with no complications.He had an uneventful recovery.Histopathological examination of the resected sample revealed the diagnosis of cecal lipoma and the associated acute appendicitis.The patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day.After 3 months of follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with no active issues.', 'The female patient was 4 years old when she came to our attention.She was brought to the practice by her parents because she complained of hypersensitivity to heat and cold, even during normal breathing.The patient had never undergone a dental examination or treatment.', 'A 61-year-old woman presented in September 2014 for workup of a 4-month history of progressive right facial palsy, associated with progressively worsening right facial pain.She reported a history of pleomorphic adenoma, first resected in 1973 with 2 recurrences and excisions in 1993 and 2003.\\\\nOn physical examination, there was a 2 × 2 cm hard, immobile, right sided preauricular mass, associated with multiple palpable level II lymph nodes.Cranial nerves (CN) were intact bilaterally except for complete right CN VII palsy.\\\\nNeck MRI revealed a multiloculated cystic lesion involving the superficial and deep lobes of the right parotid gland, and extending posteriorly to the retromandibular vein measuring 3.5 cm.', 'A 54-year-old Caucasian male patient was referred to our institution, initially with the diagnosis of a T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, which was refractory to two courses of chemotherapy (CHOEP: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, vincristine, etoposide and prednisolone).At presentation an erythroderma involving >90% of the integument was predominant ().Computer tomography (CT) scans showed enlarged axillary, inguinal and cervical lymph nodes.The complete blood counts showed a leukocytosis of 24,300/µl.Flow cytometry of the pb revealed 11,664 Sézary cells/µl with CD4+CD7- phenotype and with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 85.5. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate confirmed CD30 positivity with expression of 7% in Sézary cells.Polymerase chain reaction of pb confirmed the clonality in T-cell receptor beta and gamma showing monoclonal Vβ-β2 and two clonal Vγ1-8-Jγ1.1 and 2.1 rearrangements.While conventional cytogenetics showed a normal male karyotype, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) detected the deletion of chromosome 17p in 22 of 200 interphases with deletion of TP53 gene.Immunohistochemistry of both trephine biopsy () and skin histology revealed infiltrations with Sézary cells ().The skin histology also confirmed CD30 positivity with 5-10%, and the diagnosis was revised to SS.\\\\nThe diagnosis was thus revised to Sézary Syndrome in Stage IVA (pT4 Nx M0 B2) according to the updated classification of International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the European Organization of Research and Treatment (EORTC) ().\\\\nSubsequently, successive therapies with 3,000,000 IU interferon alpha three times weekly for 6 months, combined with 10 mg/m2 methotrexate (MTX) and 19 courses ECP including bexarotene showed no improvement.\\\\nSix months prior to alloHSCT an antibody-conjugate treatment with brentuximab vedotin (BV) was administered.The patient received five courses, which led to an improvement of skin lesions and their reduction to about 30% of body surface.CT scans showed no further progression of the lymph nodes, the CD4:CD8 ratio was 76.7 with 63.5% Sézary cells in the flow-cytometry, confirming stable disease according to the EORTC and ISCL classification (, ).\\\\nDue to preexisting comorbidities, we performed an alloHSCT from an unrelated HLA identical (10/10) and cytomegaly virus matched (recipient and donor IgG positive) 30 year old male donor with non-myeloablative conditioning (fludarabine 30 mg/m² body surface area on d-4 to -2 and total body irradiation with 2 Gy on day -1) followed by infusion of pb stem cells ().Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A from d-1 (blood target level 200 ng/ml) and mycophenolate mofetil (3x1000 mg per day).The patient received a total of 6.6x106 CD34+ cells/kg body weight, 1.1x108 CD3+ cells/kg body weight and 0.2x108 CD16+ cells/kg body weight.In the absence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), mycophenolate-mofetil was tapered 500 mg every 14 days from day 40 and discontinued on day 74 while cyclosporine A was tapered from day +56 and discontinued on d+196.\\\\nThe restaging on day +30 and +90 after alloHSCT showed residual infiltration of SS cells in the FACS analysis of the bone marrow (13 and 5% of all WBC, respectively) and chimerism of 70 and 93% on sorted CD3+ cells.The CT scan on day +90 after alloHSCT confirmed the persistent lymphadenopathy.On day + 172 after alloHCT a complete hematological remission (CR) with no infiltration of SS in bone marrow trephine biopsy, 100% chimerism on sorted CD3 positive cells from bone marrow aspirate and normal pb CD4:CD 8 ratio was documented, thus confirming graft-vs-Sézary effect ().The CT scan showed no lymph node enlargements.The inspection of the skin revealed no suspect lesions.\\\\nAfter discontinuation of immunosuppression the patient developed chronic GvHD of the ocular mucosa and the liver according to national institutes of health (NIH) criteria () on day 277 and required immunosuppressive treatment with intermediate dosage of methylprednisolone, cyclosporine A and mycophenolic acid.The immunosuppression could have been slowly tapered to 720 mg mycophenolic acid b.i.d, 5 mg prednisolone and autologous plasma eye drops as previously described (, ).Furthermore, since September 2021 ruxolitinib was added to the GvHD treatment ().Currently, 1215 days after alloHSCT the patient is in continuous complete remission of SS, having active ocular chronic GvHD.', 'A 52-year-old male without a history of hypertension and diabetes, from Huizhou, Guangdong, was referred to Huizhou Central People’s Hospital in June 2016 with symptoms of fever for 1 week.He worked on a farm with poor hygiene management and was responsible for breeding.Before admission, he was treated with flu in the local community clinic, but respiratory infection, CNS infection, septicemia, and hepatic dysfunction were suspected when he was admitted to the Central People’s Hospital.\\\\nDuring physical examination, he had fever (38.1°C) and headache with normal blood pressure (100/80 mmHg).All respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological examinations were normal.There was no evident sign of neck stiffness, initial unilateral limb weakness or flaccid paraparesis.Hepatosplenomegaly and peripheral edema were also not observed.\\\\nThe initial laboratory investigation displayed high white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.2 × 10^9/L with predominant 88.4% neutrophil, normal hemoglobin and platelet count.The liver profile showed elevated total bilirubin (TBIL) 39.7umol/L, direct bilirubin(DBIL)19.9umol/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)75 U/L, and aspartate transaminase(AST)46 U/L; renal function was normal.The chest computed tomography showed slight bilateral fiber tissue hyperplasia.These examinations strongly suggested typical infection by bacteria with a variety of clinical manifestations.\\\\nA lumbar puncture was conducted, and a CSF biochemical test was subsequently performed.The WBC count was 72.0 × 10^6/L, showing predominantly mononuclear cells, and the cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) was 220 mmH2O.The C-reactive protein was 139.87 mg/L.The level of protein in CSF was elevated, while that of glucose was normal.To confirm the pathogen leading to infection, both the blood and CSF were cultured for further characterization, as described below.Moreover, bilateral brain parenchymal enhancement of lesions with an obvious enhancement of left lateral pterygoid and temporalis were observed in the following brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).', 'A 58-year-old woman with a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension presented to our clinic for evaluation of an enlarging left breast mass that she first noticed three years ago.She stated that the mass started to progressively increase in size in the past few months.She also reported a weight loss of 34 pounds over the last nine months.On physical exam, she had a palpable breast mass of approximately 3 centimeters in the tail of the left breast.Rest of physical exam was unremarkable.Review of labs showed WBC of 8.8/mL with absolute lymphocyte count of 4400/mL, hemoglobin of 12g/dl and platelet count of 316K.Prior mammograms and ultrasounds had revealed stable intramammary lymph nodes at the site of the present lesion on the left breast over the last three years with no suspicious calcifications or architectural distortions.There were no palpable ipsilateral or contralateral axillary lymphadenopathy.The mass was subsequently percutaneously biopsied.Histopathology showed diffuse atypical small lymphocytic cells (Figure ).Immunohistochemical staining revealed neoplastic lymphoma cells positive for CD20 (Figure ), CD5 (Figure ), CD23 (Figure ), PAX5, CD4, BCL2 and negative for CD3, CD10, BCL1, and BCL6.The final pathologic diagnosis was consistent with primary small lymphocytic lymphoma of the breast rather than chronic lymphocytic leukemia.This was unexpected.Bone marrow biopsy was done and histopathology revealed diffuse involvement with small lymphocytic lymphoma (Figure ).Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies revealed trisomy 12 cytogenetic abnormality.Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Figure ) and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (Figure ).The final clinicopathologic diagnosis was small lymphocytic lymphoma (Stage 4) with breast and bone marrow involvement.She was subsequently treated with the FCR regimen comprising of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab which resulted in clinical and radiologic remission.The breast mass was no longer palpable and repeat CT scans did not reveal any evidence of any pathologic lymphadenopathy.', 'A 43-year-old right handed woman presented in 2006 with difficulty writing, impaired dexterity of the right hand, and mild unsteadiness with walking.Her sole initial symptom was difficulty writing with the right hand and with time, other dexterous movements with the right hand became affected.Her left hand was asymptomatic.On examination, she scored 30 on the MMSE.There was a subtle dysarthria.She walked well except for a slight tendency to veer to either side.There was mild bilateral upper extremity dysmetria and mild ataxia with heel-to-shin.With the hands outstretched, as well as when performing movements with the right hand (especially writing), the proximal and distal thumb flexed involuntarily into the palm.When attempting to write, there was flexion of the right thumb, extension of the wrist, and excessive flexion at the PIP joint of all fingers.She did not notice any sensory tricks for dystonia and did not have mirror dystonia.Her reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities and 3+ in the lower extremities.Brain MRI demonstrated cerebellar and brainstem atrophy.\\\\nHer mother was reported to have a progressive gait disorder, presenting with unsteadiness, hand clumsiness and dysarthria.', 'We present a clinical case of a 31-year-old man diagnosed with HIV-1 infection, with CD4 T cell count of 35 cells/mm3 (4%) and HIV RNA 305349 copies/mL (log10 5.48) having initiated ART with abacavir/lamivudine and nevirapine.Around two weeks after starting ART, the patient is admitted due to a sudden cognitive impairment (anhedonia and memory loss) with progression to gait change and imbalance.The cranial computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no lesions but the cranial MRI revealed ventriculoencephalitis ().\\\\nThe cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) had 38 nucleated cells/mm3, 175 mg/dL proteins and 37 mg/dL glucose (glycaemia 82 mg/dL).', 'In the first week of April 2021, one 11-month-old female PI calf (Brown breed) was identified in a herd of Apulia region, Italy, that consisted of 99 Alpine Brown cattle, all under the age of 1 year, including 91 lactating cows.The herd adheres to the compulsory eradication plans for tuberculosis, brucellosis and bovine leucosis and to the voluntary eradication plan for BVDV.The PI animals are destined to be slaughtered.The PI calf was taken to the Veterinary Hospital of the Department of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Bari, Italy, for a diagnostic confirmation of BVDV PI and for clinical and hematological assessments to be shown to students of the Veterinary Medicine degree course.A week before arrival, the calf was clinically examined on the farm of origin and subjected to virological and bacteriological investigations.To this purpose, nasal swabs (NSs) collected from both nasal cavities with a dry sterile swab, a fecal swab (FS) collected directly from the rectum with a similar dry sterile swab and EDTA-treated blood and serum samples were collected to monitor the health of the calf and the concomitance of other viral and/or bacterial infections.In particular, NS, FS and EDTA-treated blood were tested in RT-qPCR for BCoV, BVDV, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis.The serum sample was tested for antibodies detection using the ELISA test (Svanovir® BVDV-Ab, Boehringer Ingelheim Svanova, Uppsala, Sweden) and the neutralization test for BVDV and BoHV-1, respectively.The collected samples were immediately transported on ice to the laboratory of Infectious Diseases of the Department of Veterinary Medicine of Bari (Italy) and stored at −80 °C (NS, FS) and at RT (blood samples) before processing.\\\\nThe calf, which arrived on 12 April 2021 (T0), was immediately hospitalized in the Infection Diseases Unit of the Veterinary Hospital in a separate room and subjected to clinical examinations on the day of arrival and then two times a day during the entire period of hospitalization (Italian Ministry of Health authorization n.0017484-DGSAF-MDS-P).To minimize the stress and discomfort, the calf was kept in a pen with straw bedding, was fed a commercial concentrate twice daily and had access to haylage and water ad libitum.The facility was closed for other animals and had restricted admission for people.A trained animal technician and a veterinarian monitored the calf at least two times a day.To enter the animal room area, the investigators undressed and put on work clothes and boots.The presence of the following clinical signs was noted down: rectal temperature, pain and depression, nasal discharge, polypnea, coughing and diarrhea.Two days after arrival (T1), the calf showed hyperthermia (39.8 °C) and, consequently, NS, FS, EDTA-treated blood and serum samples were collected to monitor its health status and to assess the presence of concomitant virological/bacteriological infections.The presence of BVDV was confirmed in the blood, NS and FS, and BCoV was contextually detected in the NS.As a consequence, stool samples, NSs, serum samples and EDTA-treated blood were collected weekly up to 60 days (T60) until BCoV test were negative.', 'A 70-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities, including hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and multiple prosthetic joints including a left total knee arthroplasty (TKA), presented to the emergency room with one-week history of left knee pain, erythema, and swelling.Prior to developing the symptoms in her knee, she suffered from loose stools and abdominal pain that had resolved by the time the patient developed pain in her knee.The patient denied any recent trauma, any rashes, or recent travel.\\\\nPhysical examination was pertinent for tachycardia with a heart rate of 147 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, temperature of 100.5 F, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.Blood pressure was 101/59 mmHg. The left knee was red, hot, and swollen.The range of motion of the left knee was restricted.The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.\\\\nOn laboratory work up, hemoglobin was 15.2 g/dL (13.5–17.5 g/dL); white blood cell (WBC) count, 14,900 cells/uL (4.5–11 k/uL), total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL (0.3–1.0 mg/dL); aspartate aminotransferase, 35 U/L (13–39 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 33 U/L (4–33 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 124 U/L (34–104 U/L); s.creatinine, 2.3 mg/dl; and sodium and potassium, within normal limits.Lateral and anterior-posterior view X-rays of the left knee joint showed prior total knee replacement but no other significant findings (Figures and ).\\\\nThe initial differentials included septic arthritis of her prosthetic knee joint and reactive arthritis after her recent diarrhea.Gout and other rheumatologic conditions were less likely.\\\\nA preliminary diagnosis of sepsis due to septic arthritis was made, and supportive management with intravenous (IV) fluids, empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn), and antipyretics was initiated.Arthrocentesis was performed, and purulent fluid was drained.This was sent for Gram staining and cultures.Gram staining was significant for numerous WBCs and Gram-negative coccobacilli.The culture came back the next day growing Gram-positive coccobacilli that were subsequently identified as Yersinia enterocolitis.This was sensitive to all the antibiotics it was tested against.The blood cultures came back positive for Yersinia enterocolitica too.Yersinia enterocolitica was identified as the cause of the septic arthritis, which was likely the cause of her diarrhea prior to presenting.\\\\nThe patient was seen by orthopedic surgery in consultation and underwent resection of her left TKA and placement of a biodegradable implant without any complications.The patient was also seen by infectious disease in consultation, and based on their recommendations, the patient was discharged home to complete 6 weeks of outpatient IV antibiotics in the form of 2 g of ceftriaxone daily considering her sepsis and prosthetic material in her knee joint.The patient completed this without any complications.\\\\nThe patient was seen on follow-up, and her infection resolved completely.She has not had a recurrence or reinfection of her knee after over a year of follow-up.', \"The case study is devoted to investigating of penile pain in a 41-year-old married man.According to medical evaluation, the pain extended to the perineal and inguinal regions and it was reported to be more acute during erection.The patient was referred by urologist for sonographic evaluation of penis and testes.The pain had started 3 days before the urologist examination, following his first full erection for intercourse, after his positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.\\\\nThe patient did not have any other urologic symptoms such as discharge, hematuria, or dysuria.He denied any trauma to the penis, previous pelvic tumor, pelvic surgery and history of recent immobilization.He did not use vasoconstrictive drugs.The patient reported positive nosopharyngeal swab test for COVID-19 three weeks earlier.He had mild symptoms of COVID-19 infection including muscle pain, fever, cough, and fatigue.He had received conservative treatment and had not taken any anti-coagulants, antivirals, and corticosteroids.His medical history did not show any significant underlying disease and any risk factor for cardiovascular disease.He also did not have history of previous deep vein thrombosis.In physical examination of the penis and testes, no pathologic finding was detected such as skin tissue changes, discoloration, edema, tenderness, or palpable nodularity.\\\\nUltrasound evaluation showed thrombosis of deep dorsal penile vein while the superficial dorsal penile vein, iliac veins, and inferior vena cava were intact (Figures ,,).\\\\nLaboratory tests revealed slightly increased D-dimer level(may be due to inflammatory process of COCID-19 infection), normal levels of fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, protein S, Protein C, anti-cardiolipin antibodies and normal count of platelets and white blood cell counts.Also Tests were negative for anti-phospholipid-IgG, IgM, and lupus anti-coagulant (Table ).\\\\nImmediately after sonographic diagnose of deep dorsal penile vein thrombosis, the Rivaroxaban treatment was started with the dosage of 15 mg twice a day.Two months after starting the treatment, patient's symptoms were completely disappeared and he had no penile pain during erection and sexual disturbances anymore.Ultrasound evaluation revealed no evidence of acute deep dorsal penile vein thrombosis.Old partial thrombosis at the proximal part of the vein was seen.A little pain at the site of the partial thrombosis with the pressure of the ultrasound probe was noted (Figures ,,).\", 'Female, 83 years old (y/o), with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, carotid vasculopathy (type III, AHA) and history of (h/o) smoking affected by degenerative aortic stenosis, underwent valvular replacement with a St. Jude 21 mm mechanical prosthesis in 2000.Twenty years later, she was hospitalized for respiratory distress.TTE showed left ventricle (LV) dysfunction with severe prosthetic valve stenosis (aortic acceleration time (AAT): 140 ms, transaortic maximum speed: 4.8 m/s, maximum/median gradient: 90/52 mm Hg, indexed effective orifice area (EOA): 0.3 cm2/mq, EF: 35%).TEE showed hypomobility of the anterior leaflet.Due to the shielding from the prosthesis, it was unclear if there was a thrombus or a pannus ().As it is possible to differentiate between a pannus and a thrombus due to their different radiological density (HU > 145 and > 90, respectively) [], MDCT was performed, and it showed that the anterior aortic leaflet was stuck and surrounded by hypodense tissue (Hounsfield units (HU): 203.8) interposed between native and prosthetic annuli (effective orifice area (EOA): 45 mm2, EOA/0.15) indicating a pannus (a–c).This information was of utmost importance as instead of staring anticoagulant treatment, the patient directly underwent repeat surgical repair with a bioprosthesis.The diagnosis of pannus was confirmed by pathology.', \"A 48-year-old African American man with a medical history of COVID-19 pneumonia and obesity presented to the emergency department with left foot pain for the past three days.Initial workup returned a diagnosis of gout but also uncovered an incidental finding of a platelet count of 7x103/mL.All other labs including white blood cell count and hemoglobin were normal.The patient stated he had been hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia five weeks prior but denied any lingering symptoms, had not noticed any bleeding and denied any home medications.Additionally, the patient denied any relevant family or social history.Vital signs were stable.The physical exam did not reveal any petechiae, purpura, palpable lymphadenopathy, or visceromegaly.\\\\nChart review showed that the patient's platelet count was 325x103/ml when he was discharged from the hospital five weeks prior.Upon further workup for thrombocytopenia, a repeat complete blood count confirmed the initial finding, and microscopy did not reveal any clumping or abnormal platelet morphology.Coagulation studies were non-contributory.A viral panel, including HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), was non-reactive and folate and B12 levels were within normal limits.Ultrasound of the spleen was unremarkable.Having ruled out other causes of thrombocytopenia, we made a diagnosis of secondary immune thrombocytopenia due to COVID-19.\\\\nThe patient was admitted for observation and transfusion.The patient was given two units of platelets.The patient was also started on prednisone 40mg daily.He was discharged home on day two with a platelet count of 47x103/ml.During follow-up as an outpatient two weeks later, complete blood count (CBC) revealed his thrombocyte count was 120x103/ml.\", 'A 45-year-old female was brought in by ambulance after collapsing at home secondary to a hypoglycemic event (capillary blood glucose of 1 mmol/L with paramedics).She had a history of restrictive AN, binge-purge behaviour, and an old traumatic brain injury, leaving her with memory problems.She was well known to mental health services, having been admitted multiple times to eating disorder centres for nasogastric feeding.She had never smoked in her life and denied any alcohol intake.The patient was on ferrous fumarate, fexofenadine, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, lansoprazole, quetiapine, supplemental vitamins, regular morphine (modified release), and gabapentin.\\\\nOn admission, her blood pressure was 106/85 mmHg, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, heart rate was 64 beats/minute, temperature was 35.1 °C, and capillary blood glucose was 6 mmol/L.Her weight on admission was 37.3 kg (body mass index [BMI] = 12.6).On examination, she was clearly malnourished, cachexic, and dehydrated.The rest of the clinical examination was normal, as shown in Table .Her chest radiograph showed patchy consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes (Figure ).She was prescribed appropriate antibiotics.She was refusing treatment and was deemed to lack the capacity to make that decision.Therefore, Section 5(2) under the Mental Health Act was put in place.She was commenced on oral supplements as per guidance from the dietitian, and then switched to nasogastric feeding.\\\\nOn the night of the second day, she had an episode of decreased consciousness, bradypnoea (RR-6), and hypotension (83/64).Her blood sugar level was 6.6 mmol/L.After receiving Naloxone, her symptoms improved, and her opiates were discontinued.The following day she mentioned right upper quadrant pain.Blood tests showed worsening liver enzymes, as shown in Table .An abdominal ultrasound was performed on the fourth day of admission, which showed multiple small calculi and biliary debris, with gallbladder oedema, and a small amount of peri-cholecystic fluid (Figure ).\\\\nShe was treated for cholecystitis with amoxicillin, clavulanic acid, and clarithromycin, which led to improvement in her inflammatory markers in the following days.She underwent an inpatient magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to rule out intra-biliary pathology, which was negative.Subsequently, she was referred to surgeons for consideration of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy once deemed fit.\\\\nShe had a protracted and difficult admission.Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, her transfer to an Eating Disorders Unit proved difficult.By the fourth week of admission, her liver enzymes had improved, as can be seen in Table .Nasogastric feeding was successfully weaned as her weight improved.She was discharged on day 51 to an Eating Disorders Unit weighing 56.4 kg (BMI = 18.1) from her admission weight of 37.3 kg (BMI = 12.6).', 'A 16-year-old male presented with symptoms of blurry vision and black filamentous floaters for 1 day.He had no

intermittent fever, myalgia, headaches, tinnitus and an exanthema, which had started under his left eye.His history revealed a mantle cell lymphoma (a B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) in 2010, which was initially treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclofosfamide, doxorubicine, vincristine and prednisolone), high dose cytarabine, and autologous stem cell transplantation.After achieving a complete response, he developed progressive disease in 2015, which was treated with R-CHOP.A second complete response was achieved, and he continued to receive rituximab maintenance every other month until July 2016.For his current symptoms, he was treated with azitromycin.A consulting dermatologist observed generalized nummular to palm-sized non-pruritic erythematous macules, sparing the foot soles, which was considered either a drug eruption or a para-infectious skin reaction.An abdominal skin biopsy revealed a non-specific chronic perivascular dermatitis, deemed consistent with a hypersensitivity response.A PCR on blood was negative for EBV and CMV, and a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for respiratory viruses.His next dose of rituximab was delayed until July 18th, at which point his erythema had resolved with only minor myalgias remaining.From July 22nd the patient started to experience a right-sided headache with right-sided rhinorrhea and a tearing eye, tinnitus of both ears and a different sensation for taste, as well as relapsing (sub)febrile episodes.From August 1st, he noted a left facial palsy, and on August 23rd the patient was admitted to the neurology ward with progressive symptoms.By this time, he had developed an unsteady broad-based gait, a mild action tremor, mild apathy, dysphagia and hearing loss.He had an erythema on his wrists and left elbow and had lost 6 kg.An MRI of his brain revealed periventricular white matter lesions, and pathological enhancement of multiple cranial nerves (bilateral trigeminal and vestibulocochlear nerves

examination was done, the patients Glasgow coma score was 13/15, he had right otorrhea, ecchymosis of both eyes, the right pupil was dilated fixed, and the left one was regular and reactive to light.Patient had history of old orthopedic instrumentation, 30 years ago.\\\\nCT (computed tomography) scan was obtained, which revealed pneumocephalus, and an incidental finding of a right frontal intra-axial mass with aggressive perilesional edema.Patient received conservative management, including dehydrating measures, antibiotics, and prophylactic antiepileptic.Complete investigations showed fracture maxilla and mandible.\\\\nTwo days after admission, patient regained consciousness and re-evaluation showed right sixth nerve palsy, right optic atrophy, and anosmia.We recommended magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain with contrast, but it was not possible due to the old fracture and instrumentation, so a CT scan with contrast was done, as shown in\\\\n, and revealed an intra-axial mass with perilesional edema, and a cystic component.', 'A 27-year-old woman was diagnosed to have a fetus with left-sided CDH in her routine antenatal ultrasound (at 20 weeks gestation).Based on antenatal fetal imaging, the liver was in its thorax, the left lung was not visible, the right lung measured 1.95 × 1.67 cm and the lung-to-head ratio (LHR) was 1.275 (observed/expected LHR 29–33%

over 15 days was admitted to our department for a mass lesion in the right hilum.He presented with no face swelling and superficial varicose veins.He was a former smoker, and medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus.At bronchoscopy, the tumor was found occluding the right upper lobar bronchus and infiltrating the bronchus intermedius.It was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma by transbronchial tumor biopsy.Chest contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed that the mass of 80 mm in the maximum diameter located in the right upper lobe.The tumor directly invaded the arch of the right PA and a wide range of SVC.It was discovered that the left brachiocephalic vein (BCV) along the left margin of mediastinum walking down the line directly into the coronary sinus ().A venous flow was detected in the anterolateral descending aorta with dilatation of the coronary sinus (diameter of 21 mm) without other heart abnormalities by transthoracic echocardiography.Based on these findings, the diagnosis of PLSVC was made.There were no detectable metastases in other organs through brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), upper abdomen CT scan and bone nuclear scan.\\\\nThe right posterolateral thoracotomy was performed on October 31, 2006.', 'A 70-year-old female retired healthcare professional initially presented with a 10-day history of severe headaches without associated symptoms and with no history of head trauma.The patient had similar headaches in the past, but of shorter duration and lower intensity.The headaches developed suddenly and would occur when she leaned forward or stood up from a recumbent position.She described the headaches as an intense pressure-like sensation.Over-the-counter analgesics were ineffective.A few weeks after the onset of headaches, the patient started experiencing sleep attacks, wherein she would fall asleep during a conversation and even while standing up.She also reported having very realistic dreams that she often confused with reality.A multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) was normal, which refuted the clinical suspicion of narcolepsy.The sleep study did show mild sleep apnea, and she was prescribed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).Although the headaches spontaneously resolved within a few weeks of their onset, her sleep symptoms did not improve despite using CPAP for 6 months.She also lacked energy and motivation to participate in daily and social activities.\\\\nOver the next 6 months, she developed severe dysarthria, although she lacked insight into her speech pathology.She was referred to a neurologist for further testing.Her EEG was normal and her brain MRI (Figure ) showed mild frontotemporal atrophy.', 'A 67-year-old female with past medical history of congenital deafness presented to the emergency room with complaints of right-sided facial droop and right upper extremity weakness, tingling, and numbness.These symptoms were sudden in onset and lasted for a few minutes.Symptoms had completely resolved at the time of presentation.She did not have a history of any atherosclerotic risk factor including hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia.The initial set of vital signs were normal; routine laboratory tests including complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable.A computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast as well as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast did not show any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.\\\\nThe patient was diagnosed with TIA, and further investigations were planned to determine the etiology.', \"A 70-year-old Caucasian woman with medical history significant for stage III chronic kidney disease, transitional cell ureteral cancer status post-left-sided nephroureterectomy, and three-year history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) presented with complaints of right-sided weakness associated with paresthesias, dysarthria, and blurry vision of three weeks duration.Magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging of the brain demonstrated an enhancing, hypercellular mass centered in the left thalamus with additional foci of signal abnormality and enhancement in the cortex of the left frontal lobe and subcortical white matter (Figure ).\", \"A 45-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with postural instability and dysarthria.To lessen his instability and avoid to fall, the patient widened his support polygon.He had also reported dyspnea at effort, which occurred 3 days prior to his admission.He had a history of rheumatic mitral stenosis, since 2005, for which he benefited from a percutaneous mitral dilation in the same year.He also reported a Penicillin allergy.\\\\nInitial examination found the patient conscious.His heart rate was 125 b/m, blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg. He was polypneic and orthopneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, an O2 saturation of 96% on ambient air with the presence of bilateral crackles.He had a fever measured at 39.5C.Cardiac\\\\nauscultation revealed a low-pitched diastolic rumble, well heard at the apex.The neurologic examination revealed unsteady gait and the patient was unable to perform Romberg's test.\\\\nThe ECG showed coarse-mesh atrial fibrillation with an average ventricular rate of 90 cycles per minute ().No abnormalities were detected on the chest x-ray.Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) found rheumatic changes of the mitral valve including: commissural fusion and thickening, producing “dog leg deformity” of the anterior mitral leaflet (-A).The mitral valve area was 0,8 cm2 (-B) and the pressure gradient across the mitral valve was 22 mmhg (-E).We noted a mobile vegetation measuring 11,7 mm of length, located in the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (-C).The left atrium was dilated at 47 cm2 while size and function of the left ventricle was normal.Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) was important (-F) and the filling pressures of the left ventricle were elevated.In addition to that, we reported moderate aortic stenosis and regurgitation and mitral regurgitation at grade A.\\\\nThree sets of blood cultures were made, coming back negative as well as the HACEK organism's serologies (Haemophilus; Actinobacillus; Cardiobacterium; Eikenella; and Kingella).It was decided to perform a brain MRI based on the clinical findings.\", \"A 56-year-old gentleman with no comorbidities presented with progressive jaundice, anorexia, and weight loss of 6 to 8 weeks of duration.He had no similar complaints in past.His clinical examination apart from icterus was unremarkable.Investigations revealed direct hyperbilirubinemia of 10.3 mg/dL.Ultrasound abdomen revealed a hypoechoic lesion in head of pancreas 4 cm × 3 cm in size with dilated common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary radical dilatation.\\\\nA pancreatic protocol CECT scan was performed which confirmed the ultrasound findings.In addition to this, there was intestinal nonrotation with entire small bowel on right of abdomen and large bowel on left side.Cecum and hepatic flexure was in midline.SMA was seen coursing between the jejunal and ileal branch of SMV and to right of SMV as shown in\\\\n.There was no significant lymphadenopathy, liver lesions, or free fluid.These findings were suggestive of pancreatic head adenocarcinoma with intestinal nonrotation.CA 19–9 was elevated at 237 U/mL (normal: < 37 U/mL) and Carcinoembryonic antigen was normal.A pancreaticoduodenectomy was planned for the patient.\\\\nDuring surgery, the small bowel loops were clumped in right upper abdomen and the duodenum was vertically linear instead of the usual C loop configuration, with duodenojejunal flexure on the right side.Kocher's maneuver was performed (\\\\n).The infracolic SMA first approach helps to identify the vascular structures, as well as the replaced hepatic artery from SMA early in surgery, thereby reducing bleeding and it was our approach in this case.SMA and both ileal and jejunal branches of SMV were identified and looped at the lower border of pancreas.Inferior pancreaticodeuodenal vessels were identified to its origin and then divided.Hepatoduodenal ligament dissection was then performed.The retropancreatic tunnel was created in a plane above the portal vein superiorly and the SMV inferiorly, and then the plane was widened till the area above SMA and then above ileal branch of SMV, as we kept dissecting from left to right (\\\\n).Uncinate dissection, duodenojejunal flexure mobilization, and standard lymphadenectomy were then performed followed by division of jejunum at a slightly longer distance from the duodenojejunal flexure to gain mobility of mesentery to allow length for anastomosis, division of first part of duodenum, common bile duct, and pancreas.The vascular relations can be seen after the resection in\\\\n.\\\\nReconstruction was performed by bringing the jejunal loop up from the right paracolic side and not in the conventional retrocolic fashion.The modified Blumgart technique of duct to mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy was performed with 5–0 polypropylene, single layer interrupted hepatico jejunostomy was done using 4–0 polypropylene and stapled posterior gastrojejunostomy was done.The patient had a postoperative chyle leak and superficial surgical site infection which was managed conservatively and he was discharged on the postoperative day 25.Histopathological examination showed tumor confined to pancreas with all margins free and no node out of 16 was positive.The patient is doing well at 3-year

normal free thyroxine of 1.00 ng/dL (NR 0.84–1.68 ng/dL).Prolactin was elevated at 28.9 ng/mL (NR 2.5–17.0 ng/mL).The patient's morning cortisol was immeasurably low at <1.0 mcg/dL (NR > 10 mcg/dL) as was the patient's testosterone level at <20 ng/dL (280–1100 ng/dL).Luteinizing hormone was low at 0.05 mIU/mL (NR 1.8–12.0 mIU/L).\\\\nThe patient was started on prednisone 20 mg by mouth daily, at which point he noticed immediate improvement in his energy and appetite as well as decrease in his nausea.For chronic steroid replacement therapy, the patient's treatment was changed from prednisone to hydrocortisone 20 mg of hydrocortisone in the morning and 10 mg in the evening.The patient was additionally instructed about the dangers of adrenal crisis and told to increase his hydrocortisone to 90 mg daily if acutely ill.\\\\nWithin a month of initial diagnoses, the patient suffered acute visual bilateral field cut and loss of peripheral vision.A repeat MRI demonstrated rapid enlargement of his pituitary mass, nearly doubled in size and described as a 2.2 cm by 1.2 cm mass impinging on the overlying optic chiasm ().\\\\nThe patient subsequently underwent transsphenoidal resection of his pituitary mass.\", 'A 75-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of recurrent diffuse, pruritic rash.Examination revealed a generalized eruption of erythematous papules with minimal scale on the

present.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) abdomen showed a large multiseptated cystic lesion occupying almost the entire abdomen and adhered to the pancreas with mass effect.The lesion was well defined, lobulated, hypodense in nature, and associated with main pancreatic duct dilatation.There was also portal vein thrombosis with portal cavernoma on the CECT abdomen (Figure ).\\\\nUSG-guided FNAC revealed straw-colored aspirate with mature lymphocytes; no atypical cells were noted.Cyst amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were within the normal range (Figure ).\\\\nAfter complete preoperative workup, the patient underwent surgical exploration.On exploration, there was a large multiloculated cystic lesion extending through gastrocolic omentum, pushing the stomach up and transverse colon downwards with hundreds of cystic spaces containing lymphatic fluid (Figure ).\\\\nCysts were decompressed, and the entire lesion was excised.The anterior surface of the pancreas was forming the base of the lesion.Postoperatively patient had continued lymphatic discharge from the abdominal drain, and the patient was discharged with it (Figure ).\\\\nFinal histopathological examination showed unremarkable pancreatic tissue with attached lesion consisting of dilated lymphatic spaces with lymphatic follicles in the wall, with congested blood vessels and fibrocollagenous tissue with chronic inflammatory infiltrate.Cytocentrifuged smears from fluid show lymphocytes, and no malignant or atypical cell was seen.The patient was followed regularly in outpatient department, and drain output gradually decreased over two weeks and was removed (Figure ).', 'A 38-year-old Caucasian woman, 35 weeks into her first pregnancy, presented to the emergency department for acute right-sided hip pain which precluded weight-bearing.Her right leg was shortened and externally rotated - there was no bruising or evidence of trauma.\\\\nThe patient’s history was significant for hereditary thrombophilia (Factor V Leiden) and secondary anemia.Hip radiography revealed an unstable, displaced, right-sided femoral neck fracture with no evidence of osteonecrosis (Figure ).The decision to administer radiography, in this case, was based on the American College of Radiology guidelines, which cite an absence of in-utero deterministic effects of ionizing radiation effects after 27 weeks of gestation.Unfortunately, it was not possible to evaluate the symptoms of the patient with MRI at this time due to the coronavirus disease pandemic-induced stress on the healthcare system of our country.\\\\nThe patient denied falls or trauma during the pregnancy, nor was there any history of smoking, alcohol abuse, use of glucocorticoids, or presence of rheumatologic/oncologic disease.', 'A 35-year-old male presented with a foreign body in his left ear caused by a trauma to the left parietal area by a fishhook.The patient was in a boat on a fishing trip when the fishhook accidentally pierced his upper neck behind the left auricle and pierced the auricle of the left ear.On examination, the patient was conscious and oriented and no bleeding, swelling, hematoma or bruises were noticed.Vital measurements and systemic review revealed normal findings.The patient received an intramuscular injection of 0.5 mL tetanus toxoid adsorbed vaccine and was referred for surgical assessment and foreign body removal.Under local anesthesia, the triple needle fishhook was removed and cut by a bone nipper from left pinna and post-auricular area (Figure ).The lacerated wound was stitched by 05 Ethilon suture, left mastoid dressing was applied and the patient was discharged after prescribing per-oral cefuroxime and diclofenac for five days.\\\\nTwo weeks later, the patient returned to the hospital for follow-up.On examination, left pinna and post-auricular area were normal.However, a small, non-tender, firm 2 x 2 mm subcutaneous swelling was noticed below the ear lobule.Amoxicillin/clavulanate and diclofenac sodium were prescribed, and the patient was discharged.\\\\nIn the follow-up visit two months after the injury, the patient was assessed for a localized small, non-tender, 2 x 2 mm parotid swelling at the angle of mandible on the left side.The swelling appeared after the removal of the foreign body two months ago and did not get resolved.Ultrasound (US) of the neck showed a linear hypoechoic focus in the superficial parotid gland extending to the subcutaneous tissue (Figure ).The presence of scar or granulation tissue was suspected and no focal mass lesions were detected.In addition, a few oval-shaped, non-specific cervical lymph nodes were noted with preserved fatty hilum and a short axis diameter of 0.8 cm.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a post-traumatic scar and granulation tissue involving the superficial part of the left parotid gland and extending to the subcutaneous soft tissue (Figure ).', 'We describe the case of a 55-year-old male who presented to the emergency department via emergency medical services for the chief complaint of sudden onset shortness of breath that woke him from his sleep just prior to arrival.He reported three days of non-radiating lumbar back pain and two episodes of non-bloody emesis leading up to this event.His medical history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.His current medications were metformin, amlodipine, losartan, and atenolol.Initial vital signs revealed heart rate (HR) 75, respiratory rate (RR) 29, blood pressure (BP) 119/62, and oxygen saturation 99% on 2L nasal cannula.Temperature was 36.3°C.\\\\nPhysical examination was significant for an ill-appearing male patient who was anxious and tachypneic.He also had significant work of breathing with retractions and abdominal breathing.Lungs were clear to auscultation, with no wheezing, rhonchi, or rales.Abdominal exam revealed mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound, guarding, or palpable pulsatile mass.No costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness or midline tenderness was elicited.Neurological exam revealed no focal deficits.\\\\nDue to his presentation and multiple comorbidities we had significant concern for the possible acute coronary syndrome, dissection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism.Blood work including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), lactic acid, troponin, urine analysis (UA) was ordered.CT-angiogram of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also ordered.\\\\nComplete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 20.4 x 103/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 376 x 103/uL.Comprehensive metabolic panel was significant for a sodium of 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.1 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/l, bicarbonate <7 mmol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 67 mg/dl, creatinine 14.7 mg/dL, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 165.Troponin I was <0.012 ng/mL.Initial lactic acid was recorded at 13.9 mmol/L.An arterial blood gas revealed severe anion gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.9, pCO2 of 22.3 mmHg, pO2 of 105.5 mmHg, HCO3 of 5.3 meq/L, and a Base Excess of -24.8 mmol/l.The patient was anuric at this time.Initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR), nonspecific ST abnormalities, vent rate 73, QTC 471.The CT scan revealed an obstructing stone at the left proximal ureteropelvic junction (Figures , ) and at the right ureterovesical junction (Figure ), with resultant bilateral hydronephrosis (Figure ).\\\\nWhile in the ED the patient progressively became hypotensive and was given broad-spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin and Cefepime, due to concern for sepsis and aggressive fluid resuscitation was initiated.The patient did not respond to fluid resuscitation and was started initially on Levophed.In addition, the patient received 100 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and 2 grams of calcium gluconate for severe metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia.Due to the expected clinical decline, the patient was intubated in the emergency department.Critical Care, Nephrology, and Urology were consulted emergently in the ED.After initial stabilization, the patient was taken for immediate bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) placement by Interventional Radiology (IR) and placement of a trialysis catheter for initiation of hemodialysis afterward.Urinalysis from the PCN revealed hematuria, but no evidence of infection.\\\\nAfter successful placement of bilateral PCN, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in critical condition.He was maintained on multiple vasopressors consisting of combinations of norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine, and phenylephrine along with stress dose hydrocortisone.Repeat blood gas and labs revealed a worsening metabolic and lactic acidosis with a repeat pH of 6.7 and a lactic acid of 15.9. The patient was started on hemodialysis with a high bicarbonate dialysate for emergent clearance of hyperkalemia and refractory acidosis.After hemodialysis, the patient’s pH was 7.1, despite a worsening lactic acidosis of 17.0 mmol/L.Overnight the patient was converted to continuous venous-venous hemodialysis, a form of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).Within 24 hours the patient’s acidemia corrected and blood pressure stabilized allowing for a de-escalation of vasopressors.A repeat chemistry revealed recovering renal function along with urine production in the nephrostomy tubes.On hospital day 3, the patient was successfully extubated, weaned off all vasopressors, and CRRT was stopped.Blood and urine cultures taken prior to dialysis were negative after five days.On hospital day 6, Urology performed a cystoscopy with bilateral ureteral stent placement and removal of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes.On hospital day 8, the patient had made a remarkable recovery from being critically ill.His creatinine was 1.5, BUN 27, and he was discharged home with urology follow-up in 1-2 weeks.', 'A 15-year-old female patient was referred by a pediatric cardiologist to our pediatric cardiac surgery clinic with a confirmed diagnosis of CCL syndrome since birth by a dermatologist.Her cardiovascular symptoms started one month before the presentation with a history of recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest pain.The severity of the symptoms has increased in the past few weeks.At the time of referral, she was on furosemide 10 mg twice daily and enalapril 10 mg once daily.Her parents are phenotypically normal.All her siblings, five brothers and two sisters, are free from the disorder.Also, the patient has a remarkable family history, as her cousin is a 20-year-old male with the same disorder.There is consanguinity between parents in the family.On general examination, she had a senile appearance with generalized inelastic, loose, and sagging skin.Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 114 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 123/73 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% in room air, and temperature of 36 °C.On cardiac examination, the precordium was hyperactive, the first and second heart sounds were obscured, and pansystolic murmur grade III/VI radiating to the axilla was detected.The hematological studies were within normal limits.Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with right atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ).Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with subsegmental atelectasis (Figure ).For more assessment and operative plan, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed severe mitral and tricuspid valve prolapse with malcoaptation causing severe regurgitation of both valves with pulmonary hypertension and severe dilatation of both right and left atria (Figures -).After the patient’s condition was discussed in the heart team meeting, the plan was set for mitral and tricuspid valve repair versus replacement, depending on the intraoperative findings.Also, the patient was planned to be counseled by a medical geneticist.The case was discussed with the patient and her family as they were involved in the clinical decision.\\\\nProcedure\\\\nUnder general anesthesia, midline sternotomy was carried out, and the thymus was resected due to its enormous size.Standard cannulation was accomplished through the ascending aorta and superior and inferior vena cava with snugging around each cannula.Consequently, standard cardioplegic arrest with full flow of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was achieved as the patient was cooled down to a temperature of 30 °C.The aortic valve was immediately examined after the aorta was transversely opened, and it had some significant enlargement and dilatation of the leaflet, but the valve was manually competent; thence, no intervention was done to the aortic valve.Both atria were significantly enlarged; thereupon, right and left atrial appendages were resected in combination with atrioplasty (Figures , ).The left atrium was opened, the mitral valve was examined and showed significant myxomatous changes of both anterior and posterior leaflets, and the valve was irreparable.Hence, the decision was made intraoperatively to replace the mitral valve with a 33-mm St. Jude Medical Epic porcine valve prosthesis (Figure ).After this, through an incision into the right atrium, the tricuspid valve was found to have a cleft at the septal leaflet and the anterior leaflet with significant dilation of the annulus.Accordingly, commissural tricuspid annuloplasty was performed.The tricuspid valve test rendered a competent valve.After completing the procedure, the patient was fully rewarmed and weaned off CPB.Intraoperative TEE showed trace tricuspid regurgitation, and the prosthetic valve was well seated at the mitral position.With these findings, the patient was decannulated, chest tubes and pacer wire were inserted, and closure was performed.She was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) in a stable condition.During the first 15 hours in the CSICU, the chest tubes drained blood in a total of 1,450 mL (right lower pleura), 300 mL (mediastinum), and 1,330 mL (left lower pleura).Afterward, the patient received five units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), seven units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), two units of cryoprecipitated antihemophilic factor (Cryo), two units of platelets, and two doses of intravenous protamine sulfate (50 mg per dose).The bleeding was then controlled (Table ).The patient was shifted from the CSICU to the ward on postoperative day 3 (POD 3).All chest drains were removed subsequently, and laboratory work was within normal limits.Predischarge transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no significant changes, and the patient was planned to be discharged home on POD 6 in satisfactory condition.', 'This 48-year-old female patient was brought by her mother to the emergency department with complaints of being unarousable two hours after her usual waking time.She was diagnosed to have hypothyroidism two years ago but without compliance with treatment.She had attained menopause at 40 years of age.At 22 years, she had separated from her husband within a year of marriage but she refused to elaborate the reasons for her separation.She did not conceive during her marriage or thereafter.She had been living with her parents ever since and there had been frequent altercations regarding her laziness and the need for them to support her.Her brother had diabetes that was controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents.There was no history of other comorbid illnesses.On examination, she was drowsy, with a bite-mark on the tongue laterally and did not have any focal neurological deficits.Periorbital puffiness, ichthyotic skin, and hoarse voice were observed.Her capillary blood sugar was 24 mg/dl.She was immediately administered 100 mL of an intravenous bolus of 25% dextrose, followed by continuous infusion of 10% dextrose (50g in 2 hours) without significant improvement in either sensorium or capillary glucose levels, which remained <50 mg/dL for two hours.Moreover, she developed hypotension (80 mmHg) within an hour of admission.After obtaining samples for thyroid function and cortisol, intravenous hydrocortisone 100mg was administered.Considering her family history and accessibility to drugs, sulfonylurea overdose was also suspected and hence subcutaneous octreotide 50µg was given.Thereafter, her sugars stabilized between 90 and 140 mg/dL.\\\\nHer initial investigations were as follows: thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 1.35 μIU/mL (0.34–4.25), free T4 0.40 ng/dL (0.7–1.24), free T3 1.00 pg/mL (2.4–4.2) and random serum cortisol 12.40 μg/dL (5–25).In view of secondary hypothyroidism, computed tomography brain and other hormones analyses were also performed.An empty sella on computed tomography (CT) and skull radiograph, serum prolactin 1.04 ng/ml (1.9–25), luteinizing hormone (LH) 0.97 mIU/mL (16.0–64.0), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 0.37 mIU/mL (18.0–153.0) were seen (Figure and Figure ; Figure is a control image taken from another 45-year-old female).Electrocardiogram showed T wave inversion in all leads (Figure ).Her renal and liver function tests were normal.Fasting C peptide 1.41 ng/mL (0.81–3.85 with corresponding blood glucose being 84 mg/dL) and CT abdomen were performed to rule out pancreatic causes of hypoglycemia.Viral serologies (HIV, hepatitis B, and C) were negative.MRI brain and testing for growth hormone, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), and antidiuretic hormone was unavailable in our institution.', 'A 25-year-old female with gestational amenorrhea for 32 weeks presented to our outpatient department with complaints of a recurring headache along with pain and weakness in the legs for the past seven months.The headache was described as a bilateral, dull and persistent pain that fluctuated between mild to moderate in intensity.She also described neck stiffness along with her chief complaints but denied any nausea, vomiting, and changes in gait or memory.The pain in her legs waxed and waned over time, although progressively increasing in intensity with each passing episode.At the outset of this predicament, pain was localized to her left leg, eventually became symmetrical and later progressed to afflict both arms.She denied numbness or paresthesia.She was eventually brought to our clinical setting following an aggravation of her symptoms over the previous two weeks that lead to a restriction in mobility.At the time of this presentation, she also complained of double vision that was gradually worsening.She also added that she experienced fluctuating fevers, undocumented weight loss, and episodes of night sweats for the last four months.\\\\nInitial assessment found the patient to be alert and well-oriented, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) of 15/15, albeit thin, emaciated, and noticeably distressed due to her clinical predicament.Her heart rate (HR) was 102/minute with a respiratory rate (RR) of 18/minute, a temperature of 98.4°F and a blood pressure (BP) of 110/175 mm Hg. A neurological examination revealed generalized weakness and a bilaterally diminished muscle tone.A strength assessment revealed that she had reduced power in her upper (right arm; 2/5, left arm; 4/5) and lower (right leg; 1/5, left leg; 3/5) extremities.There was a complete absence of all deep tendon reflexes except the biceps.A comprehensive ophthalmological exam demonstrated normal visual acuity, with notable issues in the right eye which included ptosis, fixed and dilated pupil, and diplopia which manifested with the right-sided gaze.A funduscopic examination showed normal definitions.She also had a bilateral facial nerve palsy which affected the lower half of the face, along with reduced sensation along the distribution of the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve.This deficit was more pronounced on the right side of the face.On abdominal examination, an appendectomy scar was visible on the right iliac fossa.The abdomen was protuberant, soft and non-tender.Bowel sounds were audible and inguinal lymph nodes were not palpable.\\\\nInitial laboratory investigations were within normal limits, with the exception of an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 128 millimeters/hour.A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain ruled out any local pathology that could explain her neurological deficits.', 'A 66-year-old African-American female was brought to the emergency room (ER) for confusion.Her past medical history is significant for polysubstance abuse (heroin, prescription opioids) with multiple prior emergency room visits for heroin overdose, bacterial endocarditis 30 years ago with remote epidural abscess, cervical cord compression from C3-C6 and myelopathy with residual bilateral upper extremity contractures and lower extremity weakness, hepatitis C and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.According to the patient’s daughter, she appeared somnolent a day prior to the admission.On the day of admission, she seemed confused with short-term memory loss, unable to recognize the daughter’s face along with significant receptive aphasia, although she was alert and conversing.She was unable to perform the usual activities of daily living.Due to concern for stroke, she was brought to the ER for evaluation.She denied a headache, fever, malaise, night sweats, and loss of weight lately.She denied any chest pain, palpitations, loss of consciousness or seizure-like activity.\\\\nIn the ER, she was afebrile with oxygen saturation of 100% on 4L of oxygen via nasal cannula, blood pressure was 157/96 mm Hg, heart rate of 92 beats per minute.Physical examination showed a middle-aged lady who was alert, oriented to name and place but not to time, along with mild receptive aphasia.Cranial nerves examination was unremarkable.Motor examination showed decreased bulk in bilateral upper extremities with moderate spasticity, tight contractures of the arms and forearms in flexed posture with some antigravity strength, bilateral lower extremity weakness with left side worse than right.Sensations were intact to light touch and pinprick in all the four extremities.Given the paucity of extremity strength, coordination and gait were difficult to assess.She scored 14 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke scale assessment.Her initial laboratory work was significant for elevated liver transaminases (aspartate transaminase 1399 U/L (normal range 13-35 U/L) and alanine transaminase 894 U/L (normal range 7-38 U/L), elevated creatine kinase of 1790 U/L and was thought to be secondary to rhabdomyolysis.Serum magnesium and phosphorous were low at 1.5 mg/dL (normal range 1.7 -2.3 mg/dL) and 1.6 mg/dL (normal range 2.7-4.8 mg/dL) respectively.Urine toxicology was positive for cocaine.She had normal prothrombin time of 10.9 seconds (normal range 9.7-13.0 seconds), an international normalizing ratio (INR) of 1.1 (normal range 0.9-1.3) and activated partial thromboplastin time of 24.7 seconds (normal range 23.0-32.4 seconds).Computerized tomography (CT) of the brain showed heterogeneous low attenuation involving the entirety of bilateral cerebellar hemispheres with associated mass effect and partial effacement of the fourth ventricle suggestive of sub-acute infarction with areas of petechial hemorrhage along with encephalomalacia in the right insular and anterior operculum (Figure ).\\\\nThere was no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.Due to the concern for posterior circulation large vessel occlusion, an emergent CT angiogram of the head and neck was performed which ruled out any dissection, significant stenosis or occlusion of intracranial or extracranial cerebral vasculature with areas of non-opacification of superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus.Both posterior inferior cerebellar arteries were widely patent (Figure ).\\\\nThe differential diagnosis included multifocal infarction secondary to cocaine-related vasospasm, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and infective endocarditis with septic emboli (given prior history of heroin abuse).She was admitted to the neurointensive care unit for impending obstructive hydrocephalus and was started on hypertonic saline.Neurosurgery was consulted for possible external ventricular drain placement and posterior fossa decompression.She underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain along with MR venogram which showed infarcts in the bilateral occipital lobes, both hippocampi and bilateral basal ganglia in addition to bilateral cerebellar hemispheres suspicious for an embolic phenomenon (Figure ).\\\\nA magnetic resonance venogram ruled out dural venous sinus thrombosis.', 'A previously healthy 24-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a head injury after falling 15 feet, and he was admitted with a diagnosis of a TBI to his right lateral frontal lobe.He was monitored for four days in the neurology intensive care unit and then discharged after improvement in symptoms.Three weeks from the initial injury the patient was brought into the emergency department by his family with symptoms like insomnia, atypical aggression, psychosis, and impulsive behavior.Upon arrival in the emergency department, the patient admitted to new onset suicidal and homicidal ideations with a plan to shoot himself and the (illusory) “friend who murdered his family and robbed his home” with a loaded gun in his possession.He admitted that two days prior to re-admission, he had become frustrated upon return to work, had not slept for 26 hours, and began damaging items around his house.He admitted to increased aggression, hallucinations, and paranoid ideations.\\\\nThe patient, accompanied by his mother, denied any previous family or personal psychiatric history.His mother stated his personality had become increasingly impulsive and aggressive since his previous discharge from the hospital.The patient complained of worsening auditory and visual hallucinations, insomnia, headache, and visual floaters.The patient denied nausea, emesis, weakness, gait difficulty, and focal motor defects.\\\\nThe patient had an unremarkable past medical history.Hypertension was diagnosed during his initial admission and he was started on lisinopril for management.Social history included intermittent alcohol and occasional marijuana use.He denied any tobacco or other illicit drug use.He lived with his parents, was in a monogamous relationship with his girlfriend, and worked in the construction field.\\\\nUpon this admission three weeks postinjury, the patient presented with a blood pressure of 152/92 mmHg and a heart rate of 105 beats/minute.He was alert, oriented, anxious, and agitated.His five-digit forward recall was 4/5, and he was able to spell the word “WORLD” backwards and forward.The patient spoke with a normal rate and volume and without aphasia.Speech was coherent and goal-directed.Mood was anxious and affect-constricted.He had paranoid ideations with auditory and visual hallucinations.His heart had a regular rhythm without clicks or murmurs.Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, and he had a soft and nontender abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds.Neurological examination revealed cranial nerves II-XII were intact bilaterally.Patient had 5/5 strength bilaterally without pronator drift.No pathological reflexes were noted.\\\\nUpon chart review, a two-week routine follow-up CT after his initial injury revealed increasing cerebral edema on the right parietal lobe with no increasing mass effect or midline shift (Figure ).It also noted a nondisplaced fracture of the right temporoparietal region that was not commented on prior imaging.\\\\nOn day one of this admission, three weeks postinjury, the patient’s electroencephalography was unremarkable, and an MRI showed several acute/subacute cerebral contusions within the right frontotemporal region; with progression of the temporal lobe contusion (Figure ).', 'Mr. R is a 36-year-old right-handed male who was admitted to Neurology service for his altered mental status.The patient has a history of hypertension, fibromyalgia, obstructive sleep apnea, depression and substance abuse.One month prior to his presentation, he underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) when he was found unresponsive at his home.The CPR reportedly lasted for 3-4 minutes.He was hospitalized and was found to be in respiratory failure and acute renal failure.He was intubated and was treated for his renal failure.He gradually recovered and was discharged.His family members started to notice gradually worsening behavioral changes and short-term memory problems because of which, he was brought back to the hospital again.\\\\nDuring the course of hospitalization, the patient showed gradual deterioration in his mental faculties.He underwent two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies – first one during the initial admission and the second one, 10 days later.', 'A 93-year-old patient visited our hospital with hypokalaemia, malnutrition, and decreased renal function detected by a family physician.\\\\nFive years before her visit to the hospital, she had undergone bowel resection several times ().As a result, she had been suffering from diarrhoea for about three months, thought to be caused by SBS.The diarrhoea improved spontaneously and she had no abdominal symptoms.Then, one year before admission, watery diarrhoea appeared, and although antidiarrhoeal medication was prescribed, there was little improvement.\\\\nHer past history included colonic perforation, abdominal wall hernia with strangulated ileus, and resection of about 2 m 30 cm (59.1 inches) of the terminal ileum ().Five years prior to this admission, she was diagnosed with strangulated ileus, and the small intestine was resected, 7 cm from the terminal ileum and 50 cm from the ligament of Treitz ().At presentation, the patient’s blood pressure was 95/67 mmHg, heart rate was 59 beats per minute, SpO2 as 95%, and her temperature was 36.6 °C.On physical examination, normal breath sounds and heart sounds with mild systolic murmurs were observed.The abdomen was flat and soft.Murphy’s sign was negative, and there was no costovertebral angle tenderness.Lower leg oedema was observed.The results of blood tests were as follows: white blood cell count 15.30 × 103/μ (neutrophils 78.3%, lymphocytes 15.5%, monocytes 5.6%, eosinophils 0.4%, basophils 0.2%), red blood cell count 3.34 × 106/μ, hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL, hematocrit 33.2%, platelet count 27.9 × 104/μ, total bilirubin 1.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase) 48 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase) 37 IU/L, total protein 5.2 g/dL, albumin 2.5 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 18.7 mg/dL, creatine 1.13 mg/dL, Na 143 mEq/L, K 1.7 mEq/L, Cl 99 mEq/L, Ca 5.0 mg/dL, P 2.8 mg/dL, Mg 0.8 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate 34.1 mL/min/L.An abdominal computed tomography showed mild oedema of the colon, and no other obvious abnormalities ().No obvious organic abnormalities were noted on imaging, but the bowel was shortened because of repeated bowel resections.Colonic specimens showed only nonspecific inflammatory findings (a,b).We believe that this inflammatory finding was due to an imbalance between the protective and aggressive factors of the intestinal tract due to ageing.\\\\nAfter hospitalization, her electrolyte imbalance and renal function were improved by an infusion of magnesium and potassium, but the diarrhea persisted.A colonoscopy was performed and pathological specimens were taken.However, the colonoscopy, which was performed to evaluate diarrhea, did not reveal any specific findings.In addition, stool culture and histopathological examination did not reveal the exact cause.Taken together, this was likely to be de-adaptation of SBS, as a part of the clinical course.Since diarrhea and electrolyte abnormalities continued, we concluded that her bowel could not absorb nutrients, and therefore switched to central venous (CV) nutrition (delivered via a CV port), which improved her diarrhea.She was discharged in good general condition about one month after creation of the CV port.', 'A previously healthy nine-year-old boy, weighing 37 Kg, and hailing from Dhaka, was admitted to PICU with a high, continued fever that had lasted four days.He suffered with a headache and generalized body aches for two days and diffuse abdominal cramps with diarrhea and emesis for one day.He had a history of an upper respiratory tract infection three weeks earlier but had not done an rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 Ag during that time.He had no obvious contact history with a COVID-19 patient and no history of dengue infection.He tested positive for dengue NS1 Ag on the third day of fever and was admitted to another hospital.After deteriorating, the patient was referred to our PICU.On admission, he had unrecordable BP, tachycardia, tachypnea, cold extremities, breath sound was absent on right side, diminished on the left chest wall with coarse crepitations, SpO2 89% in room air by a pulse oximeter.The abdomen was distended, full flanks with diffuse abdominal tenderness.He was resuscitated, and management for dengue shock syndrome with plasma leakage was started.He was given 5L/min oxygen via a face mask, IV inotropes, albumin, colloids, furosemide, imipenem, and amikacin.His blood test results included anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, marked hypocalcemia, positive C-reactive protein, raised blood urea level, mild alteration of liver functions with coagulopathy (as given in Table ).A stool occult blood test was positive.His CXR revealed pleural effusions and pneumonitis.His ECG showed sinus tachycardia.The echocardiogram performed on the second day of admission revealed minimal pericardial effusion, bilateral pleural effusions, mild LV dysfunction (EF 59%).In addition, he had high serum ferritin, D-dimer along with a slightly raised NT-pro-BNP, normal serum troponin I.Clinically, he developed an erythematous rash on his trunk with conjunctival congestion on the seventh day of fever, which warranted further anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing.This came back positive on the eighth day of fever.After consultation with pediatric cardiologists, the patient was started on IV methylprednisolone at a dose of 30 mg/Kg for three days.On the ninth day of illness, the patient developed respiratory distress and became confused and aggressive.His blood pressure was still fluctuating.His SpO2 was about 88% with 7L/min oxygen (2L/min via nasal cannula, 5L/min through face mask).He was placed on mechanical ventilation.Repeat CXR showed persistent pulmonary infiltrations with pleural effusion (Figure ).\\\\nA brain MRI revealed no obvious neurological abnormalities.', 'A 71-year-old female with a history of in situ ovarian adenocarcinoma status post appendectomy and right-sided hemicolectomy developed generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity.An initial seizure was noted while undergoing an endobronchial biopsy procedure for evaluation of a perihilar mass.Pathology was consistent with a benign reactive lymph node.During the procedure, she developed mottled discoloration of her skin, spreading from her abdomen to both shoulders.Bag ventilation was started, and she was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) and intubated.CT head revealed multiple air emboli (Figure ).\\\\nContinuous electroencephalography (CEEG) monitoring revealed frequent periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.Her anti-epileptic medication was rapidly escalated to pentobarbital in addition to levetiracetam, lacosamide, and phenytoin.Her Glasgow Coma Scale was 3 (E:1;V:1;M:1).Neurological examination was significant for sluggish but reactive bilateral pupils and areflexic quadriplegia.She was transferred to the neurological ICU at that time.Her neurological examination remained same thereafter.On day 14 of her admission, EEG showed changes consistent with bilateral cortical dysfunction in bifrontal regions indicating severe diffuse encephalopathy.No seizure activity was noted on EEG.Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an elevated myelin basic protein but with undetected white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), and negative cytology.MRI brain scan the following day showed progressive diffuse white matter changes in a watershed distribution and centrum semiovale (Figure ).\\\\nShe was weaned from her antiepileptic regimen to levetiracetam monotherapy.', 'A 45-year-old obese man (height, 178.7 cm; weight, 97 Kg; body mass index, 30.8 kg/m2) complained of general fatigue and drowsiness at work.A blood examination revealed severe diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 10.6%), and he was accordingly referred to our university.Treatment for diabetes mellitus was started and extensive evaluations for sleep apnea syndrome were performed.Although treatment using a continuous positive airway pressure mask was initiated, general fatigue continued.Concurrently, SITSH was diagnosed based on the following findings: serum TSH, 6.890 µIU/mL; free T3, 4.9 pg/mL; and free T4, 2.29 ng/dL.\\\\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland revealed a poorly enhanced mass measuring 5 × 6 × 8 mm ( and ).The TRH loading test showed a low and delayed TSH response (pre-TSH, 6.89 µIU/mL; max TSH, 10.8 µIU/mL; 60 minutes after TRH loading).However, there were no abnormal responses for both GH and PRL on several other loading tests.The absence of a family history of SITSH or TRβ gene mutations prompted the diagnosis of thyrotroph adenoma.\\\\nInitial treatment with the somatostatin analog (SSA) did not yield any response.Further, the free T4 levels remained over 2 ng/dL after 3 courses of lanreotide autogel (90 mg).Since his diabetes mellitus was already under control, we decided to remove the tumor surgically.\\\\nThe surgery was performed using the standard endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach.The pituitary gland appeared normal on the surface.However, a midline split revealed a well-circumscribed whitish tumor inside the pituitary gland ().Complete tumor resection was achieved (), and tumor tissues were collected wherever possible.As the intraoperative pathological diagnosis ruled out a pituitary adenoma, tissue samples for electron microscopy were obtained.\\\\nHis serum TSH levels decreased drastically to 0.320 µIU/mL on postoperative day 1.However, the patient developed transient diabetes insipidus that was treated with oral desmopressin acetate tablets.Three days after the operation, he was diagnosed with influenza type A, followed by hyponatremia with a minimum serum Na level of 118 mEq/L.Electrolyte levels were closely monitored during the treatment for influenza, and he was discharged 18 days after the operation without any electrolyte management.Oral administration of hydrocortisone and levothyroxine was started after the operation, which was tapered and ceased completely after 3 months.\\\\nThe patient’s complaint of fatigue improved, and his cardiac heart rate was reduced by 10 bpm.Blood examination 6 months after the operation revealed an improvement in endocrinological parameters, including serum TSH (0.808 µIU/mL), free T3 (2.9 pg/mL), and free T4 (1.35 ng/dL).The TRH loading test showed a normal TSH response (pre-TSH, 0.589 µIU/mL; max TSH, 7.830 µIU/mL) 30 minutes after TRH loading.The patient has remained healthy for 2 years without tumor recurrence.\\\\nPostoperative MRI revealed complete tumor resection.', \"A 65-year-old gentleman with no comorbidities presented with progressive jaundice, anorexia, and weight loss since 4 to 5 weeks.He had no similar complaints in past.His clinical examination apart from icterus was normal.Investigations revealed a direct hyperbilirubinemia of 3.3 mg/dL.Ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic lesion in head of pancreas 3 cm × 3 cm in size with dilated common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary radical dilatation.\\\\nA pancreatic protocol contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan was performed which confirmed the ultrasound findings as shown in\\\\n.In addition to this, it showed a replaced right hepatic artery arising from superior mesenteric artery (SMA) as shown in\\\\n, and a reversal of relationship of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and SMA, that is, the artery to the right of vein was seen as shown in\\\\n.The complete vascular anatomy is schematically shown in\\\\n.The duodenojejunal flexure was in midline.There was no significant lymphadenopathy, no liver lesions, and no free fluid.These findings were suggestive of pancreatic head adenocarcinoma with incomplete intestinal rotation and an rRHA arising from SMA.Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) was elevated at 196 U/mL (normal: < 37 U/mL) and Carcinoembryonic antigen was normal.A pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was planned for the patient.\\\\nDuring surgery, the small bowel loops were found clumped in right upper abdomen and a Kocher's maneuver was carefully performed after interbowel adhesiolysis to free all the loops till the third part of duodenum.SMA and SMV were then identified and looped at the lower border of pancreas.Hepatoduodenal ligament dissection was then performed to identify the replaced right hepatic artery and the main portal vein.The retropancreatic tunnel was created in a plane above the portal vein superiorly and the SMA inferiorly, and then the plane was widened till the area above SMV (\\\\n).Uncinate dissection, duodenojejunal flexure mobilization, and standard lymphadenectomy were then performed, followed by division of jejunum, first part of duodenum common bile duct and pancreas.The vascular relations can be seen after resection completion in\\\\n.\\\\nReconstruction was performed as the modified Blumgart technique of duct to mucosa pancreatico-jejunostomy with 5–0 polypropylene, single layer interrupted hepatico jejunostomy using 4–0 polypropylene and antecolic stapled posterior gastrojejunostomy.The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on the postoperative day 8.Histopathological examination showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma confined to pancreas with all margins free and single peripancreatic node out of 18 was positive.The patient is doing well at 4-month follow up on adjuvant 5-fluorouracil based chemotherapy.\", \"A 44-year-old female patient had a car accident and she was thrown out from the car landing on a hard rock on her buttocks.In the district hospital, she was found to have a partial laceration of the posterior perineum surrounding an intact anorectum.The bladder, urethra, and pelvis were not injured.A sigmoid colostomy was performed and then she was transferred to a tertiary hospital.\\\\nShe had a crescent-shaped wound surrounding the anus from the three to nine o’clock position.In addition, the anus was displaced forward towards the vagina.Digital and proctoscopy examinations showed an intact anorectum and surrounding sphincters.\\\\nProgress\\\\nIn this case, the patient's wound was subject to identical conservative management procedures as in the previously mentioned case.However, the patient was discharged from the hospital earlier as it was determined that she had adequate support from a daughter who has adequate experience in nursing.As the patient's wound was clean and in its proliferation stage of healing, the patient was instructed to perform daily irrigation using handheld bidets.She was scheduled for follow-up appointments every three weeks, which she attended punctually.Consequently, the proper management of the wound caused it to be superficial and reduced to 1 x 2 cm after five months of the procedure, with no infections.\\\\nThe defecation portogram performed in a follow-up appointment revealed an anteriorly displaced anus with an anorectal angle of 70°; this angle only widened to 90° on straining, and while evacuation occurred, it was incomplete.However, no atypical rectum descent was noticed, and the patient reported complete evacuation in the toilet after the examination.\\\\nSeven months post-injury, the colostomy was closed, and five days after stoma closure, the patient reported normal bowel movement with no incontinence experienced and was subsequently discharged.\\\\nFifteen months post-injury, a follow-up report noted complete healing of the wound with adequate defecation.However, the patient reported the occasional need to use glycerin suppositories.Moreover, the patient's regime of treatment resulted in there being no fecal impaction.Figures , show the site of injury before and after treatment, respectively.\", 'A 42-year-old man was admitted to emergency service after a ski injury.He was unable to weight-bear.Effusion of the knee, severe posterior knee pain, and tenderness of the posterior structures of the knee were determined in the initial physical examination.The pain was getting worse when the knee was extended.The range of motion (ROM) was very limited, and the motion itself was causing the patient a lot of pain.The patient did not allow the tests Lachmann, McMurray, or posterior drawer to be performed due to pain and spasm.There were no findings of neurovascular damage.\\\\nTwo avulsed fragments were revealed in the plain radiographs (Fig.A&B).MRI showed the fragments belonged to PCL and lateral meniscus, and concomitant avulsion fractures of the medial meniscus and PCL were diagnosed (Fig.', 'Preoperative evaluation\\\\nA 65-year-old female, who had been previously healthy, presented to the emergency department at our institution with a six-month history of memory impairment, urinary incontinence, and ataxia.On physical examination, she was alert and oriented, but with difficulty remembering recent and past events.Her cranial nerves were intact, and she demonstrated a normal motor and sensory examination.She had no history or clinical findings of tuberous sclerosis.Contrasted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated a 4.9 X 3.0 cm heterogeneously enhancing intraventricular mass, centered on the septum pellucidum and extending into the lateral ventricles, with associated obstructive hydrocephalus (Figures -).\\\\nOperation and postoperative course\\\\nThe patient was then taken electively to the operating room for the resection of the intraventricular ventricular mass via a left frontal craniotomy, with a corticectomy through the middle frontal gyrus.', 'A nine-year-old, previously healthy, developmentally well male child, weighing 31 Kg, and hailing from Dhaka, was admitted to the PICU.He complained of high, irregular fever over the previous four days and generalized body aches, headache, abdominal cramps with emesis for the previous two days.He had a history of dengue infection two years ago and positive contact history with a COVID-19 patient one month before the illness.He tested positive for dengue NS1 Ag on the second day of fever and was admitted to another hospital.Due to respiratory distress and fluctuating blood pressure, he was referred to our PICU.On admission, the patient had low mean pressure, tachypnea, tachycardia with a cold periphery.His breath sound was diminished bilaterally and course crepitations were heard on auscultation.He was febrile with erythematous, petechial rashes on both lower limbs, and gum bleeding.His rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, and blood and urine cultures yielded no growth.Initial investigations revealed, thrombocytopenia, marked hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, altered liver functions, coagulopathy, positive C-reactive protein, negative procalcitonin, and slightly increased blood urea.His serum ferritin, D-dimer, serum troponin I, and NT-pro-BNP were very high (as given in Table ).The CXR revealed bilateral pleural effusions with pneumonitis (Figure ).\\\\nThe ECG showed sinus tachycardia.Management of dengue shock syndrome with plasma leakage was started with IV inotropes, albumin, calcium gluconate, antibiotics (imipenem, levofloxacin), and furosemide.An echocardiogram was done and showed a mild pericardial effusion, prominent dilated coronaries, LMCA (+3.0 SD), LAD (+2.5 SD), bilateral pleural effusion, fair LV function.The test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody (IgG) came back positive.After evaluating his condition and consultation with pediatric cardiologists, a single 2g/Kg dose of IVIG was administered, followed by methylprednisolone, aspirin, and clopidogrel.His general condition gradually improved with improving laboratory reports.Serial CXRs showed gradually decreasing pleural effusions.He was transferred to the pediatric ward 10 days after PICU admission and was discharged with the necessary advice and follow-up plans.', 'The child described here was first seen at the Paediatric Unit of the Santa Maria Hospital, Terni, Italy, when he was 3 years old.The hospital admission was required by parents for further evaluation of an already diagnosed EIEE.The child was born from eutocic delivery after a 39-week regular gestation.Neurological problems emerged during the first days of life when a significant hypertonus of the lower limbs was clearly evident.In the following weeks, repetitive, difficult-to-treat seizures occurred.Moreover, neuromotor and psychic development was very poor.At admission, the clinical manifestations included epileptic encephalopathy with tonic and myoclonic seizures and spasms refractory to polypharmacy, severe cognitive disability, and severe postural spastic paresis with a dystonic-myoclonic component (both cortical and truncal myoclonias at rest and in action).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed complex brain malformations such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia, corpus callosum atrophy and simplified cortical architecture ().', 'This 69-year-old male was admitted to the ICU after a dry cough for 2 weeks, oxygenation was poor and computer tomographic imaging showed typical COVID-19 pneumonia.Initially the patient received lung-protective ventilation and targeted sedation, but was otherwise stable.Treatment interventions included passive range of motion and positioning including passive mobilization into a side-edge position ().Over the next days, the patient deteriorated with hemodynamic instability and severe ARDS leading to intermittent prone positioning and continuous renal replacement therapy.The role of physical therapists during proning was to ensure correct joint positioning and pressure prophylaxis to prevent secondary complications such as nerve lesions, contractures, or pressure ulcers.Nevertheless, the long duration and repeated positioning resulted in a small pressure ulcer on the patient’s forehead.After tracheostomy, passive range-of-motion exercises, and passive side-edge mobilization were slowly resumed, whereby asynchronous ventilation and hemodynamic instability remained 2 major problems leading to further sedation and relaxation, thus inhibiting any active participation.After 24 days in the ICU, the patient scored 1/50 points on the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool (CPAx) and showed severe signs of muscle loss.The patient died soon after withdrawal of life support.', 'A 40-year-old woman presents to the ED with neck pain and non-specific neurologic symptoms including numbness, tingling, and headaches.She denies any other symptoms.A non-contrast CT of her brain is performed, which is normal.Tele-neurology is consulted, but her symptoms do not fit the stroke protocol, so no recommendations are made.The patient is discharged without any specific instructions for follow-up.\\\\nFour weeks later she returns to the ED with bilateral visual loss.She first notices visual blurring several days prior to presentation.She denies any other neurologic symptoms, has no family history of vision problems, and is otherwise healthy on no medications.On examination she is unable to see anything on the eye chart but can appreciate light.Her pupils are round, reactive to light, and without an afferent pupillary defect.The anterior segment, IOP, and eye movements are normal.The ophthalmologist on call is contacted and recommends transfer to the university hospital 90 miles away.Tele-neurology is contacted, and they recommend a CT/CTA, which are both normal.They also recommend transfer to a university.A transfer is requested but all universities in the state were on diversion and refused transfer.Attempts to see the fundus with a direct ophthalmoscope are unsuccessful.\\\\nDevastating unilateral or bilateral visual loss can occur due to a wide variety of causes.The differential diagnosis includes compressive, infectious, inflammatory, toxic, vascular, neoplastic, or hereditary causes [,,].The initial evaluation in the ED can be very helpful in guiding therapy and preserving whatever vision is present.When a patient presents with visual blurring, the first step is to determine if the problem is in the retina or the optic nerve by taking a history and performing eye signs (i.e., vitals) including red desaturation, Amsler grid testing, and fundus photography [,].The classic symptoms of retina vs optic nerve symptoms are presented in .Once it has been determined that it is an optic nerve issue, the age of the patient will guide the work-up even more than the appearance of the nerve.\\\\nPrior to the advent of MR imaging, vague neurological symptoms were difficult to evaluate.Both multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica have characteristic findings on MRI and lumbar puncture [,,].', 'A 59-year-old female, current smoker with 20 pack-years history, with a past medical history only significant for hypertension, gradually developed anorexia, nausea, fatigue, and weight loss.She initially presented to the emergency department with left flank pain and on CT scan of the abdomen was found to have diffuse osteosclerotic lesions in visualized bones.She was then followed up in primary care clinic where workup for an occult malignancy was initiated.There was no palpable mass or axillary adenopathy on breast examination.She had multiple mammograms in the past, some of which had shown suspicious architecture, which was followed up with multiple breast ultrasounds that had revealed benign findings.Mammogram was repeated and was reported benign with BI-RADS 2.Nuclear bone scan was unremarkable.CT chest revealed no pulmonary lesions but there were small mediastinal, submental, and axillary lymphadenopathy and several subcutaneous lesions on the back (one of which was excised and showed inclusion epidermal cyst).Multiple myeloma workup was negative.\\\\nWhile the workup was ongoing, the patient started to experience lower back pain associated with weakness of lower extremities, numbness, tingling, and balance issues.She developed constipation as well as urinary incontinence.MRI of the brain and spine redemonstrated similar bony lesions in vertebrae, and also revealed abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement in the brainstem extending along the entire spinal cord (Figure ).', 'A 70-year-old man with a high carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level was diagnosed with resectable pancreatic cancer.Enhanced CT revealed a 15-mm mass in the pancreatic body and dilatation of the peripheral main pancreatic duct (Fig.A).The patient underwent DP with lymph node dissection.DP was performed by transecting the pancreas at the right border of the PV with a powered linear stapler.Additional pancreatic tissue was observed on the dorsal aspect of the PV (Fig.B), and the patient was diagnosed with PAP (type II).After the diagnosis, additional pancreatic resection was conducted using a powered linear stapler.The total operative time was 527 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 730 mL.Based on the Union for International Cancer Control TNM staging, the pathological diagnosis was T3N0M0, stage IIA.In addition, the pathological margin was negative.The patient had no complications and was discharged on postoperative day 23.PAP was detected on preoperative CT images during a retrospective review (Fig.A).', 'A young man was killed by a 30-year-old man after they had consumed alcohol and cocaine.The murderer claimed he was not capable when he committed the crime because he suffered from an alcohol-/drug-caused behavioral impairment producing neurological damage, having regularly consumed alcohol and drugs since the beginning of adolescence.In detail, he reported to have started habitually consuming alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and amphetamine when he was a teenager.The defendant also claimed to be predisposed to anti-social behavior because of genetic factors.Indeed, his forensic consultant performed a genetic testing on him focused on three genes (MAOA, COMT, SLC6A4), finding that he was a carrier of the polymorphisms of 5-HTTLPR (fragment 44 bp–SS genotype) and COMT (Leu136Leu) in homozygosity.\\\\nHence, the court requested a team of forensic experts to assess the capacity of the defendant, performing toxicology testing and a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation.\\\\nToxicology testing was performed on urine (four days after the murder), saliva (two days after the murder), blood and pubic hair (10 days after the murder).In blood and saliva, it failed to find significant levels of drugs or alcohol, while in urine it detected benzoylecgoine (322 ng/mL).In the pubic hair, significant levels of cocaine (141 ng/mg), benzoylecgonine (21 ng/mg), and ethylglucuronide in concentration >30 pg/mg were found.\\\\nA full clinical/neuropsychological examination was performed.No clinical signs of neurological impairment and no signs of alcohol-dependence were observed.A personality disorder not otherwise specified was diagnosed.3-Tesla brain MRI and brain CT-PET were also performed.', 'A 14-year-old Thai girl was born via cesarean section due to premature rupture of the membrane with a birth weight of 2500 g.She is the first child of a consanguineous (second-degree relatives) couple.Both parents are healthy and have never had fractures.During her first year of life, she had delayed motor development and growth failure.At one year of age, she could not sit by herself and weighed 7.5 kg (< 3rd centile).She presented to our hospital at 14 months of age with fractures of both femora without a history of significant trauma.She was found to have ptosis of both eyes with normal teeth but no blue sclerae.She was small for her age.Her weight was 7.8 kg (3rd centile) and her length was 68 cm (< 3rd centile).Skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia, multiple healed fractures of the right humoral shaft, both tibiae and fibulae.Spine radiograph showed flattening and indentation of vertebral bodies (Fig.).A diagnosis of OI was made and intravenous bisphosphonate therapy (pamidronate 1 mg/kg/dose for 3 days) was initiated and given every 3 months.However, she sustained 1–2 long bone fractures per year from minor trauma.She required multiple corrective osteotomies to correct her deformities.At the last follow-up, she was 14 years old, weighing 20 kg.She could not walk due to her long bone deformity (Fig.).Remarkably, although she was in a special education class due to physical disabilities, her cognition was appropriate for age.She could talk fluently and do mathematics properly.\\\\nPrenatally, her younger sister was found to have a dilated fourth ventricle by an ultrasonography.She was born at term via cesarean section because of previous cesarean section and was diagnosed with hydrocephalus at birth.At 4 months of age, she had her first fracture without a history of a significant trauma, leading to a diagnosis of OI.Physical examination revealed a head circumference of 38 cm (> 95th centile) with a wide anterior fontanelle (3 × 3 cm.) and blue sclerae.She had global developmental delay (could not hold her head) and hypotonia.MRI of the brain demonstrated a large posterior fossa cyst connecting with the fourth ventricular system, moderate hydrocephalus, hypoplasia of cerebellar hemisphere with absence of cerebellar vermis, and hypoplasia of corpus collosum.', 'A 54-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, unvaccinated for COVID-19 presented with shortness of breath, cough, and pleuritic chest pain for four days.Upon initial evaluation in the emergency room, vital signs were as follows: BP was 118/63 mmHg, HR was 80 bpm, temperature was 103.1°F, and oxygen saturation was 91% on room air.Lab work showed nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2, leukopenia (WBC: 3.8x103/uL), elevated D-dimer (514 ng/mL), hyperglycemia (126 mg/dL), elevated liver enzymes (AST: 224 U/L, ALT: 175 U/L), elevated c-reactive protein (CRP) (129.8 mg/L), and elevated respiratory procalcitonin (0.26 ng/mL).Chest x-ray showed patchy bilateral lung opacities.CT chest with contrast showed moderate bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit and started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and dexamethasone.EKG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm with HR of 80 bpm (Figure ).The day following admission, the patient was started on remdesivir.After two doses of remdesivir, the patient developed severe sinus bradycardia with HR of 30-40 bpm, and remdesivir was discontinued (Figure ).She continued to have bradycardia with HR of 45-60 bpm persistently throughout the hospitalization.Potassium and magnesium levels stayed within normal limits for this patient throughout the hospital stay.', 'A 6-month old exclusively breastfed, African boy presented to the emergency department (ED) with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.In the weeks prior to presentation, he had 3 brief episodes of peri-oral cyanosis and pallor and presented twice to ED with increased work of breathing.On initial assessment by paramedics he showed no signs of life and was in asystole.He was resuscitated until spontaneous circulation was restored at 36 min.Investigations revealed low ionised calcium (0.72 mmol/L), warranting repeated intravenous calcium boluses followed by continuous infusion.Cefotaxime was commenced for presumed sepsis, and oseltamivir was added after isolating influenza A on a nasal swab.Intravenous fluids and inotropes were administered.In the intensive care unit, an echocardiogram showed severe dilated cardiomyopathy with poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25–30% [normal 55–70%]), fractional shortening (FS) of 7% [normal 29–40%], dyskinetic septal motion, global hypokinesia, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with a structurally normal heart.Rickets was confirmed radiographically (Fig.), with elevated serum ALP and PTH concentrations, and low 25OHD < 15 nmol/L (Table ).Cholecalciferol (6000 IU daily) was commenced, and intravenous calcium was continued until serum calcium normalised (72 h).Cardiac failure was managed with diuretics and vasodilators.Brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, correlating with the clinical finding of unresponsiveness to external stimuli.', 'A 53-year-old woman, with no relevant medical history so far, was brought to the ER due to a two-month history of progressive psychomotor slowness and confusion, which had worsened in the week before.At physical examination, she was agitated and febrile.Head CT scan showed some intra-axial lesions in the left frontal and temporal lobes.The cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) had mild pleocytosis and moderately elevated proteins.The serology for HIV was positive, and the nucleic acid test of the CSF was positive for toxoplasma gondii.She was admitted in the ICU with a de novo diagnosis of HIV infection, with severe immunosuppression (CD4+ count 28 cells/mm3), clinically manifested as cerebral toxoplasmosis.On day 3, she began coughing, with respiratory hypoxemic insufficiency and bilateral diffuse glass opacities on chest-CT scan (a).The presumptive diagnosis of PJP was posteriorly confirmed with both direct dye-examination and PCR positive for P.jirovecii in BAL.She was treated with TMP-SMX for both PJP and cerebral toxoplasmosis.Following one week of appropriate medical treatment, the patient had a favorable response, and was discharged to the ward for further care.\\\\nAt the end of the month, she was readmitted to the ICU because of respiratory failure and elevated lactate.Respiratory secretions and gastric aspirate were both negative for tuberculosis.Other microbiology tests (including blood serologies for other common opportunistic agents) were also negative.She repeated chest-CT, and had severe deterioration in the lung opacities, with bilateral consolidation described as possible ARDS and/or nosocomial infection.As she showed no signs of clinical improvement despite corticosteroids and High Flow Oxygen Therapy (HFOT), she was intubated, had a repeat bronchofibroscopy and started broad spectrum antibiotics.\\\\nThe patient developed septic shock and ARDS with refractory hypoxemia and she was put on VV-ECMO.The indirect immunofluorescence was positive for P.jirovecii in BAL.She completed 21 days of treatment for PJP and 7 days of piperacillin- tazobactam, with respiratory improvement.ECMO was stopped after 12 days.\\\\nPersistent fever and elevated inflammatory markers ensued, with isolation of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in respiratory secretions.Chest X-ray confirmed lobar nosocomial pneumonia.She started a targeted antibiotic course with cefepime, with good clinical, analytical, and radiological response.Roughly one week later, she was extubated to non-mechanical ventilation, and rapidly weaned off respiratory support to no oxygen supplementation.The evolution in her condition can be seen at the images in b.\\\\nShe was discharged to the ward after one month of ICU stay for muscular rehabilitation, already on antiretroviral therapy and free of acute infectious complications.', 'A 71-year-old female with the history of HTLV-1 infection for 20 years, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes type-2, peripheral vascular disease, chronic neck and back pain, nonambulatory for a year admitted to the medical service as dehydration and acute kidney injury.Neurology was consulted for worsening weakness and pain in the legs with paresthesia as well as evaluation for HTLV-1 myelopathy with pain, stiffness and gait problems.Neurological examination showed flat, mask-like face with a positive glabellar reflex.She was noted to have decreased power bilaterally in upper and lower extremities with brisk reflexes and hypertonia.Motor examination of upper extremities showed a strength of 4 x 5 with brisk reflexes and also noted to have resting as well as intention tremor.Lower extremity muscle power was 2 x 5 with brisk reflexes and bilateral clonus and bilaterally upgoing toes.Sensory examination was normal with generalized diffuse rigidity.Her workup included computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showing bilateral basal ganglia calcifications and mild cortical atrophy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain T2W image demonstrating low signal intensity from iron accumulation in the red nucleus, and substantia nigra and atrophy of the cerebral cortex and superior vermis of the cerebellum (Figure ).', 'A 66-year-old Caucasian woman with stage IIIb lung adenocarcinoma developed right hemiballismus and dysarthria following four months of nivolumab administration.The hemiballismus then evolved to bilateral ballismus in all extremities over a two-week period.Neurologic examination revealed hypophonic and dysarthric speech, orobuccolingual dyskinesias, and severe bilateral arm and leg ballismus.\\\\nInitial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without gadolinium showed symmetric T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense basal ganglia abnormalities [Figures and ].', 'A 61-year-old male patient was referred for hearing rehabilitation with CI on the left side because of progressive asymmetric hearing loss (see ) and limited communication ability, restricting his professional performance as a dentist.WRS on the left side with a hearing aid was 20%, and on the right side, 50% (FMT at 65 dB SPL).\\\\nContrast-enhanced cMRI revealed an intra- and extracanalicular VS (Samii T2) (A,B).', 'A 48-year-old Japanese woman with high myopia presented with decreased visual acuity.Axial length was 29.0 mm in the right and 28.7 mm in the left eyes, respectively; refractive errors were −11.5 and −10.5 diopter; best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/28 and 20/16, respectively.The BCVA was described by converting the decimal visual acuity into fractional visual acuity.Mild cataract was observed in both eyes.Fundoscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images showed epiretinal membrane (ERM) in the left eye (Fig.).\\\\nThree years later, she developed blurred vision and BCVA in the left eye decreased to 20/33; OCT revealed thickening of the ERM.The patient opted for vitrectomy after thorough discussion and considering recent reports showing good treatment outcome for ERM with good visual acuity [].The patient subsequently underwent uncomplicated 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with ERM and internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in the left eye.After 6 months, BCVA was 20/28.CRA was noted in the parafovea, and OCT revealed irregularities in the RPE with increased transmission signal from the sclera, suggesting atrophy of the RPE (Fig.).\\\\nAfter another 3 weeks, BCVA in the left eye decreased suddenly from 20/28 to 20/100.OCT demonstrated disruption of the interdigitation and ellipsoid zones and elevation of the RPE.Choroidal thickness at this site increased from 134 µm to 151 µm (Fig.a, b).Fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed hyperfluorescence (Fig.a), which coincided with the site where changes were observed in RPE and choroid on OCT (Fig.b).Hyperfluorescence was observed from an early stage, but no leak thereafter.Typical choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or lacquer crack were not shown on FA.Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) did not detect abnormal blood vessels suggesting CNV (Fig.b).Although fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography did not show typical CNV or lacquer crack, myopic CNV could not be ruled out.Therefore, intravitreal ranibizumab injection was recommended.However, 2 days after the injection, the patient presented with a further decline in vision to 20/222 in her left eye.Despite no obvious change on fundus examination, OCT revealed a nodule-like outer retinal lesion with disruption of the RPE, suggesting PIC.Choroidal thickness had decreased slightly to 142 μm (Fig.c).Careful observation was recommended after thorough discussion with the patient concerning possible treatment options, including steroid therapy.\\\\nOne month after the injection, BCVA improved to 20/100 and the nodule-like lesion regressed, leaving an expanded RPE defect with a decrease in choroidal thickness to 84 μm.The lesion was judged to be inactive, and further observation was recommended.However, the area of CRA increased gradually to 0.38, 0.90, and 1.59 mm2 and choroidal thickness decreased to 52, 40, and 16 μm by 14, 30, and 40 months post-injection, respectively (Fig.).CRA progressed at a rate of 0.45 mm2/year.The CRA was measured on color photographs of the fundus using ImageJ software (freely available at ).Three years after the injection, BCVA was 20/70 in the left eye and two new atrophic lesions were noted in the parafovea (Fig.c).', 'A 54-year old woman underwent a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for a 2.3 cm rapidly growing thyroid nodule ().The cytological examination showed both solid groups and discohesive oxyphilic cells (Hürthle cells) in a background featuring lymphocytes.Based on these features, the FNAB was diagnosed as a low-risk indeterminate lesion (AUS/FLUS).Five months later, the nodule grew to 3.6 cm, and thus another FNAB was performed; a diagnosis of suspicious for malignancy was rendered.The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy (nodule 4.1 × 3.4 cm) with cervical lymph node dissection, and a removal of the internal right jugular vein that was invaded by the tumor.Microscopically, a Hürthle cell carcinoma with foci of paucicellular anaplastic cancer was diagnosed (Stage IVB; cT3b cN0 Mx/pT4b pN0 M0).In particular, large epithelial cells featuring granular eosinophilic cytoplasms, hyperchromatic nuclei with evident nucleoli were arranged in a solid and trabecular pattern alternated with scattered anaplastic spindle cells and necrotic areas.Immunohistochemical stainings for pancytokeratin and PAX8 were positive in both these components.Conversely, TTF1 was expressed by Hürthle cells only.Thyroglobulin (Tg) immunostaining was negative in both Hürthle and anaplastic spindle cells ().\\\\nTwo years later, because of the appearance of a hacking cough, a 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed and revealed several millimetric lung hypermetabolic areas.Over time, the serum Tg under LT4-suppressive therapy had increased from 0.15 to 19 ng/mL.Two months later, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the presence of multiple lung lesions, in particular one in the medium lobe invading the airways (21 mm diameter), a second in the right inferior lobe (4 mm diameter) and a third in the left lung (9 mm diameter).A transbronchial biopsy of the largest lesion was performed, and the histology was consistent with a thyroid cancer metastasis.\\\\nOn January 2019, the patient came to our observation, 18FDG-PET/CT showed a further increase in the number, size and FDG uptake of the lung lesions, and the appearance of multiple lymphadenopathies in the neck and mediastinum.In particular, the lesion in the right inferior lobe had grown to 8.5 cm, with a SUV max of 50.The histology of the tumor has been reviewed by two independent pathologists who confirmed the diagnosis of ATC.The molecular test performed on the primary thyroid tumor for BRAF, NTRK and ALK mutations was negative, and chemotherapy with cisplatin plus doxorubicin was given.After three courses of treatment the disease was stable, but after three further courses the disease progressed.The patient was then given four courses of paclitaxel; however, the disease continued to progress.Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 performed on the primary tumor was negative, but the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) was noticed.The primary tumor was also tested for microsatellite instability-MSI using a panel of five markers (BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346 and D17S2720), and the tumor was instable for the presence of mutations of BAT-26, D2S123 and D17S2720.Based on these results, on January 2020 a treatment with lenvatinib (24 mg daily) in combination with pembrolizumab (200 mg every 21 days) was started as a salvage therapy.After five months of treatment, a partial response was achieved with a reduction by 76% of the lung lesion in the medium lobe from 8.5 cm to 2 cm and at 18FDG PET/CT a drop in SUVmax from 50 to 4.7. The treatment was continued, but lenvatinib was progressively reduced to 10 mg daily due to grade 3 diarrhea, vomiting and weight loss.After 12 months, the administration of pembrolizumab was delayed every six weeks.The lenvatinib treatment has been withdrawn several times, and the patient compliance was low.In spite of that, after 18 months of treatment all lung lesions continued to respond to therapy (PR with a reduction by 50% of the sum of the diameters of the target lesions by RECIST) ().Unfortunately, a pleural nontarget lesion showed a progression, over four months, as demonstrated by the 18FDG-PET/CT (10 mm vs.7 mm, a 43% increase by RECIST and a SUV max of 25.8 vs.6.5) ().The pleural lesion is being treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (42 Gy in seven fractions).The patient is still alive, and the treatment with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab is still ongoing.', 'A 25-year-old man presented to our epilepsy center for evaluation of seizures.He was born at term without any developmental delays and had no risk factors for epilepsy including traumatic brain injury, brain surgery, febrile seizures, central nervous system infections, or family history of seizures and no significant past medical or psychiatric comorbidities.Three years prior to his presentation he had his first seizure.He did not remember the event, but while attending basic training in the Army, he was reportedly found in the shower confused by his fellow soldiers.There was no tongue bite or urinary incontinence, but he was disoriented afterward for much of that day.He had another episode within the same month while he was performing physical training exercises, whereby he collapsed and remained confused for hours, but no report of witnessed convulsions.An evaluation at that time was unrevealing.He had 12 episodes in the next 3 years.They were all similar, some associated with lateral tongue laceration suffered during the event.He was seizure-free for 6 months and then began to have spells at least monthly.He denied an aura or premonition preceding his seizures.His wife reported at night that he would “cry” at the onset and then appears to have clonic jerking bilaterally and symmetrically, up to 3 minutes in duration.He was reported to be distressed for a few minutes after the episodes.Brain MRI was reportedly normal and EEG abnormal, but the reports were unavailable.', \"The first patient was a 44-year-old man with Ebstein's anomaly resulting in severe right atrial and right ventricular dilatation with right moderate ventricular dysfunction and severe tricuspid regurgitation.The patient also suffered from HIV immunodeficiency with previous cerebral infection and Kaposi's Sarcoma.In the post-operative period he suffered from severe right ventricular dysfunction with low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), which required ECMO support.\", 'A 21-year-old man without any medical history presented with a closed fracture of\\\\nthe lower third of his tibia secondary to a motorcycle accident without evidence\\\\nof cranial trauma ().His vital\\\\nsigns and neurological examination were normal.The patient was hospitalized and\\\\ntreated with skeletal traction.One day later, he became confused and agitated\\\\nwith progressive depression of consciousness that progressed to coma.He\\\\nexhibited an extensor motor response, but the brainstem reflexes were normal.\\\\nThe vital signs were as follows: arterial blood pressure, 127/76mmHg;\\\\nrespiratory rate, 18/min; heart rate, 133/min; and rectal temperature, 38.8°C.\\\\nHis pulse oximetry was 85% on room air.Invasive mechanical ventilation and\\\\nhemodynamic resuscitation were initiated immediately.After cardiorespiratory\\\\nstabilization, a head CT scan revealed small and multiple subcortical hypodense\\\\nlesions in both the frontal and left parietal regions ().\\\\nA chest CT revealed small filling defects in the left ventricle and the superior\\\\nvena cava.A nodular image was observed in the right pulmonary artery and could\\\\nhave corresponded to an embolus.Fat embolism syndrome was diagnosed.A\\\\ntransthoracic echocardiogram revealed an estimated mean pulmonary artery\\\\npressure of 35mmHg with no disorders of ventricular motility and preserved\\\\nsystolic ventricular function.The size and function of the right ventricle were\\\\nnormal, and there were no interatrial or interventricular shunts.An\\\\nelectroencephalogram revealed background slowing without epileptiform\\\\ndischarges.The biochemical profile was unremarkable with the exception of\\\\nthrombocytopenia (98.000/mm3), anemia (Hgb 8.7gr/dL) and an elevation\\\\nof the CRP level to 134 mg/L.General critical care supportive measures were\\\\nprovided, and the patient received IV methylprednisolone at 10 mg/kg/day for 72\\\\nhours.\\\\nOn ICU day 5, sedoanalgesia (remifentanil-propofol) was stopped.After 20\\\\nminutes, the patient exhibited generalized and profuse sweating, tachycardia\\\\n(166/min), arterial hypertension (187/99mmHg), and tachypnea (36/min) with\\\\nasynchrony of mechanical ventilation and bilateral extensor posturing; these\\\\nmanifestations were all compatible with PSH.The symptoms were alleviated with\\\\nthe restoration of sedoanalgesia but continued to occur 4 times per day and were\\\\ntriggered by physiotherapy maneuvers, aspiration of secretions and baths with\\\\ncold water.The average duration of the episodes was 33 minutes.A brain MRI\\\\nrevealed multiple T2-hyperintense lesions in the periventricular white matter\\\\nand bilateral frontal and parietal subcortical regions ( and ).\\\\nTreatment with propranolol at 120mg/day, morphine at 18mg/day and gabapentin at\\\\n900 mg/day resulted in progressive reductions of the frequencies, intensities\\\\nand durations of the PSH episodes.', 'A 13-year-old boy presented with a history of headache, nausea and vomiting with an acute onset 2 weeks earlier.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord revealed left cerebellar expansive lesion with no evidence of metastasis.', 'A 34-year-old male presented with a 6 mm bluish nodule, slowly growing on his forehead.An excisional biopsy was performed, which revealed a pigmented lesion with rare mitotic figures and multiple microscopic satellites, extending into fat (Clark level V) to a depth of at least 4 mm ().Sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative for neoplasm.Immunohistochemical stains for Melan-A and HMB-45 were diffusely reactive and -catenin showed non-specific cytoplasmic staining.Ki-67 demonstrated a low proliferative index (<5% in tumor cells).Four-color in situ hybridization was performed to rule out melanoma which showed normal results.Fusion analysis for 104 using targeted RNA sequencing related genes did not reveal any gene rearrangements including PRKCA and PRKAR1A.Targeted mutation analysis for over 50 cancer-related genes showed GNA11 c.626A>T p.Q209L oncogenic mutation.Finally, whole-genome DNA methylation profiling and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) cluster analysis were performed as described above.Genome-wide copy number profiles determined from the DNA methylation data failed to reveal significant copy cumber changes (A).t-SNE cluster analysis matched our case to the group of melanocytomas (B).Methylation profiling of tumors offers highly efficient and reliable information for classification of tumors and future studies aiming to explore the optimal use of this technique will warrant improved diagnostic and management approaches for pigmented lesions when there is a concern for malignancy.', 'A 29-year-old male was brought to the hospital by ambulance after collapsing at home.He was found to be bradycardic and hypoglycaemic with a capillary blood glucose level of 2.3 mmol/L.He had a history of eating and anxiety disorders and was not on any regular medications.On admission, his weight was 37.3 kg (BMI = 11.6).His blood pressure was initially un-recordable but subsequently was recorded to be 104/72 mmHg. His capillary blood glucose level was 4.7 mmol/L, and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15/15.On examination, he was noted to be severely malnourished and cachexic.The rest of the clinical examination was normal.LFTs were very abnormal, as shown in Table .\\\\nSince admission, he seemed to lack insight.Due to problems keeping him compliant with medication and intravenous glucose, he had a number of hypoglycaemic events in the first two days of admission.The following day, he was deemed not to have the capacity.He underwent Mental Capacity Assessment and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards.He was ultimately placed under Mental Health Act 5(2) and was started on nasogastric feeding.His liver enzymes worsened further after the introduction of nasogastric feeding, but we were reassured by a normal non-invasive liver screen and ultrasound.\\\\nHis condition, liver tests, and liver synthetic function improved over the course of his 24-day admission (Table ), but his stay was associated with difficult behaviour.He was eventually discharged to an Eating Disorders Unit.', 'A 46-year-old woman with a history of familial adenomatous polyposis and rectal cancer underwent PD with lymph node dissection for a newly diagnosed duodenal papillary carcinoma.Pancreatectomy was performed by transecting the pancreas superior to the PV.The pancreatic parenchyma was subsequently identified on the dorsal side of the PV (Fig.A) and transected, resulting in the exposure of a section (2 mm in length) of the main pancreatic duct.The remaining pancreas was mobilized caudally.An additional section was made in the pancreatic body caudal to the cricoid pancreatic junction so that the pancreatic cross-section was oriented in 1 plane.The diagnosis was PAP (type II).The total operative time was 439 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 250 mL.Based on the Union for International Cancer Control TNM staging, the pathological diagnosis was pT1aN0M0, stage IA.In addition, the pathological margin was negative.\\\\nAlthough the patient had a grade-B pancreatic fistula (International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula Classification) that was diagnosed on postoperative day 3, the patient recovered after conservative treatment, which is continuous drainage until 2 days before discharge, and was discharged on postoperative day 18.We retrospectively reviewed the patients’ preoperative CT images and identified the PAP (Fig.B).', 'A 64-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia and chronic pulmonary disease presented at the ER with fever, shortness of breath and a worsening cough despite a previous complete course of antibiotics for presumed CAP.She was hypoxic, with isolated elevation of CRP and diffuse ground-glass opacities on thoracic CT-scan (a).Her status deteriorated despite antibiotics and oxygen supplementation in the Intermediate Care Unit, so she was transferred to the ICU and intubated.Three days after IMV and prone positioning, she was connected to VV-ECMO due to refractory respiratory acidemia.Anti-HIV testing was positive.Immune and viral study revealed severe immunosuppression (9 CD4+/mm3) and high serum viral load (4.050.000 copies/mL) and TMP-SMX plus corticosteroids were started for presumed PJP, at the recommended PJP treatment dosage.Diagnosis was confirmed by positive immunofluorescence for P.jirovecii in BAL.\\\\nECMO was discontinued after 10 days.During the weaning off invasive ventilation, there was recrudescence of ARDS with increased ventilatory parameters and need for prone positioning.Nosocomial infection was considered, broad spectrum antibiotics were started and bronchofibroscopy repeated, with persistently positive immunofluorescence for P.jirovecii and a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for cytomegalovirus in BAL.She completed a total of 33 days of treatment with TMP-SMX and 21 days of ganciclovir with respiratory improvement and started ART.She was extubated after 83 days and was transferred to the ward after three months of ICU stay for muscular rehabilitation, without other dysfunctions.\\\\nFollow-up imaging can be seen in b.She was transferred to a rehabilitation unit with a residual need of oxygen support (2 L per minute), from which she recovered after some months of pulmonary rehabilitation.', 'A patient of Ukrainian origin (UKR29) was born after the first normal pregnancy (39 week of gestation) from a healthy 27 year old mother and 32 year old father.At birth, the child was registered as a male.Birth weight was 3500 g and length was 53 cm.At the age of two months, the patient was examined due to hypospadias and bilateral cryptorchidism.At that time hormonal analysis was performed.At the age of 14 months a comprehensive examination, such as karyotyping, urological examination (including gonadal and pelvic ultrasound and MRI investigation) and hormonal analysis (including testosterone synthesis stimulation test) were performed.', 'Case History: A 52-year-old white male inmate with a history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) therapy and enalapril therapy for hypertension was admitted to the emergency room for repeated lipothymia in the absence of sweating, with hematemesis from the previous evening and melaena from three days before.The patient was hemodynamically unstable with acute anemia.The hemoglobin value upon admission was 6g/dL, while the procalcitonin in the blood was not evaluated.Therefore, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed, which revealed a narrow lumen of the second portion of the duodenum; furthermore, the esophagus-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGDS) examination revealed multiple sub-centimeter lymph node formations in the stomach with normodistended walls due to insufflation, and fundus and gastric bodies occupied by food residues and clots; at the level of the first duodenum, there was an ulcerated lesion covered by a large clot.After a worsening of the condition, the patient was transferred to Intensive Care, was intubated and underwent therapy to restore hemodynamic balance.On the fifth day, the hemodynamics were unstable, and the anemia persisted.An emergency gastroscopy was performed in resuscitation, which revealed the absence of blood in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, and ulcerative lesion of the duodenal bulb with circumferential extension to the intestinal wall.Conditions precipitated due to common complications of hypovolemia.Hemorrhagic shock and peritonitis due to enterobiasis were assessed as causes of death.After 72 h, an autopsy was performed in accordance with the recommendations on the harmonization of forensic autopsy rules of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (1999) and according to the commonly accepted criteria for sudden cardiac death (SCD).Femoral blood was analyzed for alcohol (ethanol) and volatiles by head-space gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector (GC/HS-FID).All post-mortem specimens were screened for the presence of the main different classes of drugs (pharmaceuticals and illegal drugs), using immunological or chromatographic methods as appropriate.A systematic toxicological analysis (STA) was performed by the LC-MS/MS system (API 3200 triple quadrupole ABI-SCIEX) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode.', 'An 11-year-old boy with Alagille syndrome received a related liver allograft during first year of life.Being EBV-negative at transplantation, seroconversion occurred 2 years later.Initial immunosuppression was based on tacrolimus, followed by a combination with mycophenolate mofetil.Ten years after transplantation, he suffered from severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and phono-/photophobia without B symptoms.Funduscopic examination revealed bilateral papilledema.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain demonstrated multifocal lesions in the left hemisphere (Figure A).', 'The patient was a 72-year-old male who presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of headache and seizure-like activity with shaking of his bilateral upper extremities.His past medical history was significant for CLL with 13q deletion diagnosed 6 years prior to presentation.He was treated at that time with fludarabine and rituximab for 4 cycles; however, he was not able to complete a 5th cycle due to prolonged cytopenia.Two years later due to progression of disease, he was started on ibrutinib 420 mg daily and continued for 2 years.He developed severe neutropenia while on ibrutinib, and treatment was held for two months until resolution.He presented to the ED one month after resuming ibrutinib.\\\\nAt presentation, the patient was alert with the only examination finding of episodic shaking movements.He was afebrile and had a leukocytosis of 15,200/µL with 66% lymphocytes.Initial workup included computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast which showed no findings to explain presenting symptoms.Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation was negative for epileptiform activity.With persistent symptoms he was started on anticonvulsants with levetiracetam and phenytoin.A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast was obtained, and it showed a nonspecific focal area of increased signal involving the right frontal cortex ().', \"A 23-year-old nulliparous woman was admitted to a state hospital in Ankara Hospital with regular uterine contractions at 40 weeks of her pregnancy.She had no known prenatal risk factor except a history of a splenectomy, which was performed because of trauma-related hemorrhage according to her statement.Cesarean section (CS) was performed for obstructed labor without any complication, and severe PPH was diagnosed sixteen hours after the surgery.A postpartum hysterectomy was performed urgently because of uncontrolled bleeding.Persistent tachycardia and hypotension were recorded during the surgery and prehysterectomy hemoglobin value of 4 mg/dl was reported.Six units of erythrocyte suspension and four units of fresh frozen plasma were given during the surgery for replacement of the lost blood.Unfortunately, cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) developed in the last stages of the surgery, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed for 40 minutes until spontaneous heart beats began.The patient could not be extubated after the surgery and neurological examination revealed early signs of cerebral ischemia.Then, the patient was taken to Hacettepe University Hospital for intensive care and further evaluation.\\\\nShe had fixed bilateral dilated pupils, her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was three, her body temperature was 33 centigrade degrees, her blood pressure was 143/70 mmHg (MAP=97), her heart rate was 120 beats per minute, and arterial pH was 6.81.Extensive periphery edema was observed, and moist rales were auscultated, which indicated the onset of pulmonary edema.Pneumothorax in the apical lobe of right lung, interlobular septal thickening, and ARDS findings were detected in thorax CT.Mechanical ventilation was applied with positive pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).Complete blood count, blood biochemistry, arterial blood gas, coagulation profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) panel, cardiac enzymes, electrocardiography (ECG), and posteroanterior chest X-ray were evaluated.Multiple organ failure due to hypovolemic shock was diagnosed.Central vascular access was established.Fluid replacement and inotropic support with noradrenaline and dopamine were applied.The patient began to have treatment-resistant tonic-clonic seizures; antiepileptic and anesthetic drugs were given to stop the seizures.Targeted temperature management was started with surface temperature-management device.Hypothermia (34°C) was applied for the first 24 hours.Then normothermia (36°C) was applied for the next three days.The seizures were stopped after three days.Broad spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and colistin) were administrated.Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and bilateral cerebellar herniation.\\\\nDuring the search for the possible medical cause of the severe bleeding the patient's past medical record was evaluated, and it was found out that the patient had splenectomy at the age of sixteen.\", 'We present the case of a 30-month-old male who was brought to the family medicine clinic with a complaint of abdominal bloating and persistent diarrhea after every feeding for four months.His stools were foul-smelling and occurred more than four times a day.The diarrhea was associated with a failure to gain weight.The parents reported that the child has a normal appetite with no history of vomiting or feeding intolerance.There was no history of fever, night sweats, rash, cough, or joint pain.The child did not have any recent sick contact.The patient was seen by several general practitioners for the same complaint, but no diagnosis was obtained.\\\\nThe patient had an unremarkable past medical history.He did not have any previous hospital admissions.He had no history of previous surgeries.He does not take any medications and was not known to have any food or drug allergies.Regarding the perinatal history, the child was full term with a birth weight of 3.5 kg.The labor and delivery were unremarkable for any complications.The child was up to date with his vaccination schedule.Regarding the developmental history, the child reached the developmental milestones at the appropriate ages, and there was no parental concern regarding his development.The social history was noncontributory.There was no history of diseases running in the family.The child was not born of a consanguineous marriage.\\\\nUpon examination, the child was awake and alert and did not appear sick.No dysmorphic features were noted.The patient was below the second standard deviations for weight and height.He appeared pale, and there was no scleral icterus.His vital signs were as follows: heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 80/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 bpm, and temperature of 36.8°C.Abdominal examination revealed a soft and non-tender abdomen with no organomegaly and had normal bowel sounds.Neurological examination, including hearing and vision tests, was normal.No evidence of muscle wasting was noted.The cardiorespiratory examination was unremarkable.The initial laboratory investigation revealed a hemoglobin level of 14.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 5100/µL, and platelet count of 370,000/µL.Liver enzymes were mildly elevated.The total protein was 2.9 g/dL.His random glucose level was normal.Stool analysis, including routine culture, ova, and parasite testing, was negative.Stool testing for reducing substances yielded negative results.The remainder of the laboratory evaluations is summarized in Table .\\\\nBecause of the clinical and laboratory findings, the patient was referred to the pediatric gastroenterology center for further investigation.The patient underwent upper endoscopy, which showed no abnormal gross findings.However, mild duodenal inflammation was evident in the histopathological examination of the obtained specimen.The patient underwent a 72-hour fecal fat collection, which indicated the presence of fat malabsorption.Subsequently, the fecal pancreatic elastase level was measured as 20 fecal μg/g.Such findings were consistent with exocrine pancreatic dysfunction.To exclude the possibility of cystic fibrosis as the underlying etiology of malabsorption, a chloride sweat test was performed and yielded negative results.\\\\nA dedicated abdominal computed tomography scan to evaluate the pancreas for any structural abnormalities was performed.The scan demonstrated complete replacement of the pancreatic parenchyma by fatty tissue (Figure ).The suggested differential diagnoses by the radiologist for the fatty replacement of the pancreas included cystic fibrosis, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and Johanson-Blizzard syndrome.The blood sample of the patient was sent for genetic analysis.The diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome was established as the analysis revealed a mutation in the SBDS gene (Table ).The detected mutation was previously reported in the literature [].\\\\nThe patient was treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.After two months of follow-up, the parents reported that the patient had significant improvement in diarrhea.A weight gain was observed.Since the patient did not have any history of bleeding or recurrent infections, treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was not offered.', 'A 37-year-old man with a VNS presented for further evaluation.The patient had focal seizures with dyscognitive symptoms and occasionally evolution to bilateral convulsive seizures since he was 18 years old.Several events were captured during an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) admission, all of which localized to the right temporal region.An MRI of his brain did not reveal any structural abnormalities.', 'The 33-year-old right-handed male patient, with no history of brain damage had suffered from a stroke.Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an infarction lesion in the left frontal lobe, insula, and basal ganglia (Fig.', 'We present a 5-year-old female child who was symptomatic since the early neonatal period with skin lesions, intermittent painless vaginal bleeding, and breast enlargement.For these complaints, the parents took the child to the nearby health facility, but they were reassured.Compared to her peers, her growth in length was fast since her early childhood, but she had poor weight gain.At the age of 3 ½ years, she presented to an orthopedic clinic with bowlegs for which she was seen and sent home without any intervention.But after one week, she had a trivial fall down accident, and she sustained pathological fractures on both upper and lower extremities.Plaster of Paris (POP) cast was applied for the lower left arm, and open fixation with plate was done for the left femur.\\\\nDuring the procedure, tachycardia was detected, for which she was investigated and diagnosed to have hyperthyroidism.She was initially put on propylthiouracil (PTU) and propranolol.After eight months of the procedure, there was displacement of the plate.The orthopedic surgeon decided to revise the operation, but the thyroid function was not controlled for which she was referred to a paediatric endocrinology clinic for better management of hyperthyroidism.\\\\nOn physical examination at the paediatric endocrinology clinic, she was emaciated.Her weight was 16 kg (between 10th and 25th percentiles) and her height was 115 cm (on the 95th percentiles).Weight for height was far less than 5th percentile (underweight), based on CDC growth charts.Her pulse rate was 123 bpm, and she had protruded eyes.CAL spots were noticed on her face, neck, and trunk ().There was a 5 cm by 3 cm anterior neck mass with an irregular surface ().There was also breast enlargement.She had a grade III early systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border.There was swelling and tenderness at the right midshaft of the humerus and short POP on the left lower arm.She had a wide gait.Based on her clinical findings, she was diagnosed to have MAS.', 'A 22-year-old healthy woman presented to the emergency department complaining of a five-day history of several red and painful areas that were associated with swelling of the lower extremities.Her complaint started one day after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.She had received all vaccinations during childhood without any complications.There is no history of preceding infections including COVID-19 infection, sore throat, or diarrhea.In addition, she never complained of prior skin lesions or systemic diseases.She did not use any topical or systemic medication.All the laboratory investigations were normal.She stated that there is no history of contact with the sick patients and no family history of tuberculosis.Skin examination revealed multiple, tender, and erythematous nodules were present on her both legs.Based on the patient history, examination, and laboratory investigation all pointed to the vaccine-related erythema nodosum; however, we considered the Arthus-like phenomenon which can mimic the erythema nodosum lesions.She received oral ibuprofen 600 mg four times daily to relieve symptoms.Three days after receiving the treatment, she improved and the nodules started to flatten (Figure ).Two weeks later, on the follow-up examination, her symptoms had completely resolved.', \"A 5-year-old boy initially presented with headache, right eye pain, and vomiting, to a rural district hospital in the State of Sabah, East Malaysia on Borneo island.The boy also experienced difficulty in walking, blurring of vision, and fluctuating consciousness 1 month before admission.There was a significant (but unquantified) loss of weight and anorexia.He completed his bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination but missed all scheduled shots after his first birthday because of poor family support.On examination, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9 was documented (E2V2M5) with left lateral strabismus.The pupils were unequal (4 mm/3 mm) and sluggish.Power in all four limbs was 4/5 (Medical Research Council scale) with normal reflexes.Babinski was downgoing, and Kernig's sign was not elicited.\\\\nThe boy was transferred to our center for further evaluation and treatment.Non-contrast CT brain showed acute hydrocephalus with cerebral edema.Subsequently, an external ventricular drain was inserted.Intra-operatively, the opening pressure was high, and outflowing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless.\\\\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed diffuse enhancing nodular leptomeningeal thickening, especially at the basal cisterns ().No intra-axial lesion was present.Small non-enhancing cystic lesions were seen along the leptomeningeal surface (), and no restricted diffusion was depicted.A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was considered, and an extensive TB workup was undertaken.The positive results from that battery of tests were a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 90 mm/h and elevated CSF protein with normal CSF glucose levels.Otherwise, the Mantoux test was negative, and the blood, CSF, and CSF TB cultures showed no organism.The CSF for acid-fast bacilli as well as CSF GeneXpert were also negative.CSF latex agglutination was negative for streptococcus Group B, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, and escherichia coli.Both gastric lavage for acid fast bacilli stain and gastric lavage for GeneXpert were negative.\\\\nSmear-negative TB was considered after reviewing the biochemical and imaging findings.Using the Composite Reference Standard (CRS) criteria, this child was classified as probable TB ().A standard anti-TB regimen was started consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethionamide.Intravenous dexamethasone was prescribed during the first 2 weeks of admission and was subsequently changed to oral administration.\\\\nThe boy's condition improved considerably after 14 days, and he was well enough to undergo a comprehensive ophthalmology examination.He had a visual acuity of 1/60 in the right eye, and there was no light perception in the left eye.A positive right afferent pupillary defect was detected.Ophthalmoscopy showed normal macula bilaterally.\\\\nBoth his parents were screened and found to be negative for TB.He was discharged well after a 4-week hospital stay.\\\\nOne month later, he presented again with vomiting, unsteady gait, and anorexia.The follow-up MR brain study revealed exuberant nodular leptomeningeal enhancement that was more extensive than the initial study ().Also, the previously seen cystic lesions have increased in size and number ().MR spectroscopy (single voxel placed at the thickened tentorium cerebelli) showed a markedly elevated choline:creatine ratio of 4.34 and absence of a singlet peak at 3.8 ppm ().A biopsy sample was obtained and sent for histopathological examination (HPE).Transcranial approach at the right Keen's point was used to obtain the biopsy sample.The patient incidentally needed a revision of his external ventricular shunt at that time, so dural tissue was obtained via the Burr hole just prior to the shunt revision.\\\\nHistopathological examination (HPE) revealed a moderately cellular neoplastic proliferation with background desmoplastic and myxoid changes seen from the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain slides ().The cells were fairly monomorphic with mild nuclear pleomorphism displaying enlarged round to oval nuclei with fine chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli ().Occasional mitosis was seen ().The Ki-67 proliferation rate was high, accounting for about 80% ().Immunohistochemical (IHC) studies showed that the tumor cells were positive for S100 and synaptophysin ().Given these findings, the boy was diagnosed with DL-GNT.\\\\nA family conference was held to counsel the parents on possible treatment options.The parents decided to opt for palliative treatment.The patient succumbed to the illness 3 months later, 22 weeks in total, after diagnosis.\", 'A 41-year-old Japanese woman presented to our clinic with a 4 month history of bilateral groin pain and right buttock pain.Her right hip was more painful than her left hip.There was no history of trauma, alcohol abuse, or steroid use.Her medical history included iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed 2 years earlier, after which she had been on iron supplements.She had no fracture episodes, including fragility fractures.\\\\nHer height, body weight, and body mass index were 155 cm, 42 kg, and 18.7 kg/m2, respectively.She was able to walk for approximately 10 minutes without a stick, albeit at a slow speed.Limitations in the passive motion of her bilateral hip joint were observed thus: flexion, 100°, internal rotation 5°, external rotation 15°, and abduction 20°, on both sides.She was able to perform a straight-leg raise of the right limb with substantial pain.The neurovascular status of both lower extremities was intact.The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system for the evaluation of hip-joint function (JOA hip score) was 46 points for her right hip and 56 points for her left hip.The score was based on a total of 100 points, comprising 40 for pain, 20 for range of motion, 20 for the ability to walk, and 20 for activities of daily living [].\\\\nStandard radiographs of both hips (Fig.a–c) demonstrated no characteristic findings such as the crescent sign, sclerotic band pattern, and collapse of the femoral head, and no joint space narrowing was seen in either femoral head.MRI of both hips (Fig.', \"A 50-year-old male patient presented with a one-day history of right leg weakness, numbness, and urinary retention.There was mild back pain and right leg weakness for two weeks which worsened significantly during the last 24 hours.On neurological examination the patient‘s right leg was weaker than the left (2/5 and 4/5 on Lovett test, respectively), the patellar reflex was exaggerated, and Babinski sign was positive bilaterally.Also, on the right side, there was sensory loss in the leg and below the Th8 dermatome.On the left, there was sensory loss below Th10 dermatome and distal loss of temperature sensation.\\\\nPast medical history revealed a cervical trauma which occurred 30 years ago when a glass chip lodged into the left side of the patient's neck.The patient removed the visible glass shard from his neck and did not seek medical attention; therefore no clinical and radiological investigations were carried out.No neurological symptoms followed this incident.\\\\nComputed tomography (CT) of the lumbosacral and thoracic regions showed a mild convexity of the L5-S1 intervertebral disc with no other clinically significant findings (“Siemens SOMATOM Emotion 6”) (images not shown).To further explore the possible causes of the patient's symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the C1–L2 segments was performed (“Siemens MAGNETOM Avanto 1.5 T”).\", 'A 34-year-old man with no previous history of chronic illness and a non-smoker presented with a history of headache, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, and insomnia for three days.During the initial examination, he was conscious and alert.His blood pressure (BP) was 111/71, pulse rate (PR) 40, respiration rate (RR) 14/min, body temperature 36.7, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 96% under ambient oxygen conditions.The patient had a clear chest, without any crepitating sounds in the cardiovascular system (CVS; S1+S2+0).An abdominal exam showed a soft and lax abdomen, and both lower limbs were normal.The status of the central nervous system (CNS) was normal, all cranial nerves were intact, and chest X-ray and chest CT scans were performed (Figures -).EKG showed sinus rhythm, first-degree heart block with prolonged QT interval, and bigeminy (Figure ).Echo revealed a normal echo study (Figure ).General clinical and blood parameters of the patients are shown in Table .Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all patients reporting to the hospital with fever were routinely tested with the PCR test for COVID-19.Also, a nasopharyngeal swab was tested by RT-PCR and proved to be positive for SARS-CoV-2.', 'A 43-year-old-male with no known medical problems presented from an outside hospital with concern for intraabdominal hemorrhage.He was in an MVC three weeks prior and presented with complaints of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, left-sided chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.A CT scan showed fluid in the lesser sac, suggestive of pancreatic hemorrhage, so he was transferred to the University of Kentucky Medical Center for further management (Figure ).\\\\nInterventional radiology was consulted, and celiac angiogram showed an arterio-portal fistula in the liver which was embolized with 900 um particles Embozene (Palo Alto, CA: Varian Medical Systems, Inc.), as well as a few tiny rounded foci of contrast enhancement in the spleen which was managed conservatively without embolization (Figure ).Following the procedure, the patient developed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and increased abdominal distension.A repeat CT scan four days later showed an increase in the size of the lesser sac hematoma and a pseudoaneurysm in the anterior spleen (Figure ).Surgery was discussed with the patient, which he elected against and preferred to leave the hospital.\\\\nHe returned to the hospital two weeks later with decreased appetite, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, and weakness.He was found to be anemic with a hemoglobin of 6.4 g/dL (down from 7.8 g/dL).CT scan and angiographic images revealed worsening diffuse multifocal parenchymal perfusion abnormalities and innumerable punctate foci of contrast pooling in the spleen, compatible with high-grade splenic injury and the Seurat spleen angiographic sign (Figures , ).\\\\nCoil embolization of the splenic artery was performed with postembolization angiography showing no anterograde flow through the splenic artery, significantly decreased opacification of the previously noted intraparenchymal pseudoaneurysms, and opacification of the spleen via collaterals (Figure ).CT scan one month later revealed normal splenic parenchyma, with a persistent hematoma anterior and superior to the spleen (Figure ).\\\\nThe patient continued to have a complicated hospital course and was found to have multiple myeloma confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy specimen.He, unfortunately, passed away just over a month later due to complications from multiple myeloma.', 'A 36-year-old male, overweight and with HIV infection diagnosed in 2009, with poor adherence to appointments and complete discontinuation of ART in the three months before admission.\\\\nThe patient presented at the ER with a 3-week history of worsening cough, dyspnea, and fever.Initial assessment showed hypoxia, fever (39 °C), elevated CRP, 6 CD4+ lymphocytes/mm3 and several ground glass opacities on thoracic CT-scan (a).He started empirical treatment with TMP-SMX plus corticosteroids at the recommended PJP treatment dosage and was admitted to the ward.The need for oxygen support increased in the next few hours and the patient responded poorly to HFOT.Twenty-four hours later he was admitted to the ICU and VV-ECMO was started.No tracheal intubation was performed.PJP was confirmed by positive immunofluorescence in BAL.\\\\nAfter 9 days of ECMO support the patient became delirious and agitated, which caused flow problems in the extracorporeal circuit and eventually led to the need for sedation and subsequent intubation.He completed 21 days of treatment, initially with TMP-SMX, then changed to atovaquone plus primaquine due to hematologic toxicity.ECMO support was maintained for 26 days.\\\\nHe was transferred to the ward for rehabilitation after 37 days of ICU stay, and already on ART.The follow-up CT-scan can be seen in b.\\\\nAll four patients are being followed and regularly observed as part of our Infectious Diseases program and are functional and radiologically recovered, a summary of the patients’ characteristics and evolution is presented in .', 'A 42-year-old woman presented at the emergency department with acute onset of right flank pain.The patient had an extensive past medical history of endometriosis for which she underwent several surgeries.Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed right perinephric hemorrhage and an exophytic hypervascular mass arising from the lower pole of the right kidney with a maximum diameter of 5.5 cm (Fig.).In the lung bases multiple thin-walled cysts were observed (Fig.).Though the tumor did not demonstrate the intratumoral fat density typical for angiomyolipoma, the concomitant presence of cystic lung disease in a premenopausal woman was suggestive of spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage from a renal angiomyolipoma in a patient with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.Based on the imaging characteristics hypernephroma could not be ruled out however.Subsequent CT of the thorax, performed several days later, showed multiple thin-walled cysts of various sizes spread throughout the lung parenchyma.The lung apices and lung bases were equally involved.No nodules were present.Based on these imaging findings a definite radiological diagnosis of LAM was made (Fig.).A brain MRI performed to rule out tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) was normal.', 'A previously healthy 41-year-old male, presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining about involuntary movements of the left arm and abrupt onset that had started 12 hours prior to the admission.He complained of asthenia, adynamia, polyuria, and hyporexia for the last three days.Upon arrival, his blood pressure was 129/82 mmHg with a heart rate of 101 beats per minute; the respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute and the temperature was 36.4°C.The capillary glucose level was 566 mg/dL.On physical examination, his left arm had a persistent and arrhythmic violent high-amplitude movement, mainly affecting the proximal muscles, which were consistent with monoballism (Video ).The patient was alert and co-operative.Speech, cranial nerves, strength, muscle stretch reflexes, and cerebellum examination were unremarkable.\\\\nThe patient’s initial blood workup showed a serum sodium of 145 mmol/L (normal range: 135–145) with a corrected sodium of 152 mmol/L for a glucose of 517 mg/dL; potassium 3.7 mmol/L (normal range: 3.6–5), chloride 88 mmol/L (normal range: 98-107), magnesium 0.73 mmol/L (normal range: 0.66-1.85), calcium 2.5 mmol/L (normal range: 2.15-2.5), and serum lactate 1.8 mmol/L.An arterial blood gas analysis showed a moderate metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.4 and a bicarbonate of 8.7 mmol/L; a calculated osmolarity of 332 mOsm/L (normal range: 285–295) and a high anion gap of 48 mmol/L (normal range: 8-16).Urinalysis was relevant for glycosuria (1,000 mg/dL) and ketonuria (80 mg/dL).These findings were consistent with a mixed hyperglycemic state (ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar state).Complete blood cell count and renal function tests were within the normal range.\\\\nThe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was normal (Figure ), without any evidence of ischemia or hemorrhage.', 'A 70-year-old male with medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, strokes, initially presented to the Neurology clinic with new transient episodes of gait disturbance, left-sided dysmetria, intermittent diplopia, and vertigo.His symptoms were attributed to recurrent transient ischemic attacks involving the posterior circulation.Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the neck showed moderate left vertebral artery (VA) V4 and origin stenoses.His symptoms persisted despite being on aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin.After 4 months, a repeat CTA neck showed progression of left VA stenoses with development of a V4 segment intraluminal thrombus ().He was started on oral anticoagulation for 2 weeks without symptoms improvement; therefore, a decision was made to proceed with elective cerebral angiogram with the intent to treat the left VA origin.\\\\nCerebral angiogram one week later showed 90% left VA origin stenosis and distal V4 segment occlusion.Final angiography following left VA angioplasty revealed markedly improved VA flow, and 50% remaining stenosis of the proximal left VA.\\\\nA few hours postoperatively, the patient developed new onset left upper extremity dysmetria and paresthesia that resolved after 10 minutes.He was discharged from the hospital after 2 days without needing physiotherapy.On the following day, he returned to the emergency room with left hemibody paresthesia and gait unsteadiness.MRI brain showed acute posterior upper cervical cord infarction, confirmed with a dedicated MRI cervical spine ().', 'A 57-year-old woman presented with vertigo.An MRI of the brain revealed a mass in the right posterior fossa (Figure ).', 'An 84-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension presented with weakness, dry cough, and shortness of breath for four days.The patient had received two doses of the COVID vaccine, with the second dose in March 2021.In the ER, her vital signs were BP 133/93, HR 103 bpm, RR 22 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 96% on 40 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, and afebrile.Laboratory assessment is in Table .Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive.Chest X-ray on admission shows worsening right pleural effusion with new opacity obscuring the lower two-third of the right lung and a new pleural-based opacity in the left upper lobe (Figure ).CT chest with contrast shows large right pleural effusion and associated right basilar consolidation and abdominal ascites.The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit and started on methylprednisolone, piperacillin-tazobactam, remdesivir, and baricitinib.The patient clinically deteriorated on Day 2 and was transferred to the intensive care unit for thoracentesis and possible intubation.Thoracentesis removed 1.95 L of bloody, serosanguineous fluid obtained, with partial resolution of the effusion (Figure ).On Day 3, the patient developed septic shock, florid renal failure, and lethargy and was started on intravenous fluids and norepinephrine drip.Chest X-ray showed near-complete opacification of bilateral lung fields and subsequently was intubated.On Day 4, tense ascites were noted and the patient underwent paracentesis, which removed 4.25 L of bloody, serosanguinous fluid.Renal replacement therapy started.The patient was deemed to have a guarded prognosis with multiorgan failure.', 'Another 34-year-old male patient who smoked visited the hospital with a history of fever, runny nose, and diarrhea for seven days.There was no complaint of shortness of breath or chest pains.The patient was tested for central nervous system (CNS) response and reflexes and was alert and conscious.Examination of clinical vitals parameters was performed and recorded as BP: 126/76; PR: 43; RR: 21/min; body temperature: 36.6°C; oxygen saturation (SpO2): 98%; CVS: S1+S2+0; chest bilateral vesicular breathing, and no lower limbs edema.EKG reports showed sinus bradycardia with a prolonged PR interval and QT interval; a U wave was observed in V1 (Figure ).Chest X-ray and chest CT showed unremarkable findings (Figures -).Echocardiography also revealed a normal echo study (Figure ).General clinical and blood parameters of the patients are provided in Table .\\\\nPatient 2 was suspected of COVID-19 due to a non-symptomatic fever.The nasal swab of Patient 2 was tested by the same procedure as for Patient 1 and was SARS-CoV-2 positive.\\\\nTreatment\\\\nBoth patients were admitted to the isolation room and treated conservatively without hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.They were administered 1 mg IV atropine and showed a transient change from bradyarrhythmia to sinus rhythm.', 'A 67-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and history of long-term tobacco abuse, who recently quit smoking, presented with shortness of breath, cough, myalgias, and malaise for one week.The patient had received two doses of Pfizer COVID vaccine, with the second dose in February 2021.In the ER, her vital signs were blood pressure (BP) 120/71, heart rate (HR) 78 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) 20 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 85% on room air, and afebrile.Laboratory assessment on admission is in Table .Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive.Chest X-ray on admission shows mildly patchy bibasilar pulmonary infiltrates and a calcified pulmonary nodule in the mid-right lung (2.0 cm) (Figure ).The patient was admitted to the general medical ward and started on 6 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, remdesivir, dexamethasone, furosemide, azithromycin, and enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.Despite multiple measures, the patient did not improve, requiring more aggressive management.Repeat chest X-ray showed slight interval improvement of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and needed 4-5 L per minute via nasal cannula (Figure ).', 'A 77-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Room with a three-day history of oral lesions and jaw tightness.She had presented to a different hospital four days prior due to nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia which were deemed secondary to gastroparesis.She received symptomatic treatment and, once stabilized, was discharged home.However, over the next three days, she developed oral sores and jaw tightness, which prompted her to seek medical attention again.Her physical examination revealed normal vital signs, mild dehydration, trismus, and white ulcers on the visible portion of the tongue that were suspicious for oral candidiasis.Laboratory data revealed mild leukocytosis (WBC 11.33 × 10³) and moderate hyponatremia (123 mmol/L) thought to be secondary to volume depletion and low solute intake.A CT scan of the head and neck was unremarkable.The temporomandibular joints were intact.The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with diazepam, cyclobenzaprine, nystatin, and chlorhexidine mouthwash and was given nutritional supplementation.She was discharged after two days with a plan to follow up as an outpatient.However, she returned two days later with worsening jaw tightness and inability to swallow, for which she was readmitted.\\\\nHer past medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and a history of deep venous thrombosis.Prior to admission, medications included glipizide, atorvastatin, telmisartan, and rivaroxaban.She was a lifetime nonsmoker and denied alcohol use.She denied recent trauma or skin lacerations, and reported having completed her primary immunization series against tetanus as a child.Her most recent tetanus booster was in 1965.\\\\nOn physical exam, blood pressure was 147/82, pulse was 75, respiratory rate was 16, and temperature was 97.9°F (36.6°C).She was euvolemic and in no apparent distress.The presence of trismus was evident—the patient was unable to open her mouth beyond 2 mm.Laboratory data were remarkable for hyponatremia (122 mmol/L), and the patient was placed on normal saline.\\\\nThe following day, the patient developed three brief episodes of tonic-clonic seizures in the setting of hyponatremia (127 mmol/L) and was treated with intravenous (IV) lorazepam, IV levetiracetam, and 3% saline infusion.An urgent computed tomography (CT) did not reveal any acute intracranial process.The seizures resolved, and the sodium level normalized, but the patient persisted with trismus and dysphagia.As part of the workup, she underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and temporomandibular joints, as well as a laryngoscopy and triple-phase bone scan, all of which were noncontributory.', 'A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of persistent bright red blood per rectum.Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease with three prior myocardial infarctions, recurrent cerebrovascular accidents requiring anticoagulation with warfarin, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and endometrial cancer status post radiation therapy.Fifteen months prior to the current presentation, the patient was noted to have a grade 1 endometrial adenoma but was not considered a good surgical candidate due to multiple comorbidities.Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to her long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially.Her only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy.She eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain.The patient denied any prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.Her bleeding was described as one large episode of bright red blood per rectum associated with blood clots.She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or melena.The most recent colonoscopy was performed four months ago and revealed three diminutive polyps in the transverse colon with pathology confirming tubular adenoma.\\\\nHer physical examination was significant for mild left-sided abdominal tenderness but was otherwise unremarkable.Rectal examination was notable for nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood.Blood work revealed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL (normal range 4.3-10.0 k/uL) and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL (normal range 11.8-14.8 g/dL), which is similar to the patient’s baseline.Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 and blood urea nitrogen was elevated to 39.International normalized ratio was 2.0. Due the large volume of hematochezia and presence of anemia, the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a large, fungating, friable, and ulcerated nonobstructing mass in the sigmoid colon.The mass was noncircumferential, measured 4 cm in length, and was located 15-19 cm from the anal verge (Figures , ).Biopsies were obtained with cold forceps for histology and the proximal and distal margins of the mass were tattooed.Histology showed invasive and moderately differentiated carcinoma without visible goblet cells.Given the patient’s history of endometrial cancer, immunohistochemistry was performed and was consistent with an endometrial (endometrioid subtype) primary.\\\\nPan-computed tomography was negative for any obvious distant disease.The tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal as well.The patient subsequently underwent surgical resection of the affected colon followed by radiation therapy.At a follow-up visit one year later, the patient was doing well without active GI complaints.', 'We report the case of a 31-year-old Caucasian woman, gravida 3, para 1, who was referred after a second trimester fetal anatomy screening at 20 weeks gestational for a suspicion of a complex fetal cardiac malformation, for which several specialized opinions tried to reach consensus.\\\\nThe obstetrical history of the patient includes a previous Caesarian section with a normal course of parturition and a spontaneous miscarriage.The current pregnancy presented a low risk for aneuploidy according to the performed cell-free fetal DNA test.The classical karyotype performed after the abortion did not reveal any chromosomal abnormalities.\\\\nPrevious ultrasound evaluations were incongruent and reported the following findings:an isolated aortic arch anomaly (supposedly aneurysmal dilation from which the left common carotid artery emerges) and coarctation of the aorta with the anterograde flow; ventricular septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, and a vascular formation located superior from the aortic arch with the appearance of an arteriovenous fistula; aneurysmal dilation located above the pulmonary trunk bifurcation and a dilated left common carotid artery with a retrograde flow; minor ventricular septal defect with a normal ductus venosus triphasic flow.\\\\nWe performed fetal echocardiography, which demonstrated a mild cardiomegaly with a left deviated 72-degree heart axis, normal aspect of the four-chamber view, a small membranous ventricular septal defect, and ductal aortic coarctation; the ductus venosus flow was normal (, and ).In addition, we identified an aneurysmal structure measuring 1.63/1.25/1.16 cm with turbulent Doppler flow, situated above the emergence of the pulmonary trunk and continued by a dilated vascular structure that bifurcates in the cervical region; the aneurysm seemed connected to the left pulmonary artery as well.A dilated left subclavian artery was also suspected (, and ).\\\\nIn the context of complex cardio-vascular malformations, the patient requested the termination of the pregnancy by drug-induced abortion.\\\\nThe hands-on dissection of the fetus revealed a set of abnormalities that could stand as an anatomical basis for what has been found during the ultrasound examination.\\\\nThe first and the most pronounced aspect was the distention of the whole venous system of the neck and mediastinum.The specimen presented a linguo-facial vein that described a rather sinuous pathway alongside the inferior margin of the mandible ().Both the linguo-facial vein and the external jugular vein appeared with a markedly increased caliber, around 4–5 times larger than expected for this gestational age.Both left and right jugular veins and the right subclavian vein were assessed as three times larger than usual, respecting the normal relations to the neighboring structures ( and ).\\\\nThe confluence between the left jugular and subclavian vein into the left brachiocephalic vein was observed to be very dilated to superior and inferior, extending above the superior margin of the omohyoid muscle as well as below the inferior concavity of the aortic arch.Moreover, on the inferior side of the enlarged brachiocephalic vein, a vessel could be observed descending lateral to the left vagus nerve and communicating with the left pulmonary artery.The left pulmonary artery was observed to be dilated as well, around twice as normal ().\\\\nRegarding the great vessels of the heart, there are some anomalies to be discussed.A narrowing of the aortic arch was identified distally to the emergence of the left subclavian artery ( and ).A large, patent ductus arteriosus was found, ending right at the narrowing level observed in the aortic arch (ending right at the coarctation level) ().The left subclavian artery was dilated as well, sizing as much as the ascending aorta and the aortic arch, creating the illusion of a terminal branch rather than a lateral one ( and ).\\\\nHeart analysis concluded no distinct changes in heart architectural formation for this gestational age.Atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial concordance was noted.Atria and ventricles were increased in relation to the mediastinum.Surprisingly for an aortic coarctation, the right atrium was not found to be enlarged.', 'A 58-year-old Caucasian man did a video visit with his primary care physician, in which he complained of severe pain in the distribution of his herpes zoster that had occurred years before.No vesicles were visible.He was placed on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory during the day and Tylenol with codeine at bedtime.Despite receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccination seven months earlier, he presented to the ED with a fever, fatigue, muscle aches, sinus congestion, and a cough.COVID PCR testing was positive, but chest X-ray was normal.A comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count were normal.He was discharged to quarantine at home.Two days later, the patient returned to the ED with acute loss of vision in both eyes to 20/400, no relative afferent pupillary defect was present, and fundus photography in the ED with non-mydriatic camera was normal.Additional laboratory assessments that were found to be abnormal included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (40), C-reactive protein (33), and D dimers (2000).Chest CT revealed ground glass changes consistent with COVID-19; pulse ox revealed diminished saturation of 88%.A non-contrast head CT was normal, but an MRI of the brain and orbits revealed a large occipital stroke.', 'Patient 3, a 13-year-old boy, presented with mild to moderate speech and developmental delay and attention deficit disorder (ADD).He did not have hypotonia.His OFC was 52.5 cm (−1.25 SD).He was 156 cm tall (−0.75 SD).No structural brain anomalies were seen on MRI.', 'A 54-year-old male, with alcohol-related liver cirrhosis and a calculated Model for End- stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 28, presented for deceased donor LT.ESLD was complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and esophageal varices.A preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed 10 months before transplantation demonstrated normal size and systolic function of both ventricles (RV and LV), no valvular or regional wall motion abnormalities, normal pulmonary artery pressures, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 65%.The TTE did, however, demonstrate bi-atrial dilatation, and evidence of diastolic dysfunction with an E/A ratio of 0.9, a deceleration time (DT) of 278 ms, and tissue Doppler early diastolic velocities of 8 cm/s at the annulus and 12 cm/s at the septum indicating impaired relaxation.References for degree of diastolic dysfunction are provided in Table .A dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE) was negative for ischemia and an electrocardiogram (EKG) performed at the same time as TTE demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a prolonged QTc interval of 476 ms.\\\\nShortly after the beginning of pre-anhepatic phase, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated an EF of 40–45% with no wall motion abnormalities.The surgical procedure was complicated by blood loss of 5.5 l with the patient receiving 3 L of crystalloids, 1 L of 5% albumin, 16 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 15 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 3 units of platelet concentrate, and 3 units of cryoprecipitate.Despite the significant blood loss and reduction in EF, hemodynamic stability was maintained throughout the case with minimal vasopressor support (norepinephrine (NE) infusion 0.02–0.05 mcg/kg/min with intermittent boluses (10–20 mcg) during reperfusion).Hemodynamics and arterial blood gas data is presented in Table .\\\\nThe patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) for postoperative management in stable condition.\\\\nIn the SICU, the patient initially remained intubated and sedated with propofol and fentanyl infusions titrated to a Riker Sedation Score of 3–4.Weaning attempts failed due to episodes of agitation and hypertension.Despite a normal postoperative hepatic Doppler study and both laboratory and clinical improvement in liver function, the patient’s neurological status did not improve.A brain MRI performed on post-operative day (POD) 3 was normal.', 'Our patient is a 53-year-old male who worked as a coal miner.In spring of 2017, he noticed enlarging scalp nodules and right hip pain.He also complained of fatigue but was otherwise asymptomatic.Because of the hip pain and nodules, he came to the emergency department where a CT scan showed an enlarged right frontal scalp mass that measured about 4 cm ().MRI also revealed a right frontal scalp mass and extensive vasogenic edema localized to the right frontal lobe with a 5 mm midline shift at the foramen of Monroe ().', 'A 33-year-old female living in Fresno, California presented to the hospital with progressively worsening diplopia and headache for 5 days.Chart review showed that she had been diagnosed with coccidioidal meningitis three years ago when she presented with similar headaches and reduced visual acuity.Computed tomography (CT) of the head at the time showed hydrocephalus.CSF opening pressure was 52 cm H2O.Coccidioides complement fixation titer of the CSF was positive at 1:16.She was started on oral fluconazole 1000 mg daily for adequate CNS penetration and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed at that time.She was eventually discharged home but lost to follow-up.\\\\nIn the Emergency Department on Day 0, her vital signs were stable within normal range.Physical exam was benign, other than oblique diplopia.CT of the head showed hydrocephalus and a right posterior parietal ventriculoperitoneal shunt tube ().Lumbar puncture was performed on Day 1.Opening pressure was 17 cm H2O.CSF analysis revealed leukocytes of 51/uL with 69% lymphocyte predominance, glucose 23 mg/dl, protein 324 mg/dl.CSF studies showed positive Coccidioides complement fixation at 1:32 and VDRL 1:32.Fungal culture of CSF was negative.RPR titer was 1:32.Upon further investigation, the patient had been diagnosed with syphilis about 2 years ago when she presented to an Emergency Room with vaginal pain and swelling.RPR at that time was positive at 1:16, but the patient had already left the Emergency Department and did not receive any treatment.The Department of Public Health also confirmed that she had never received appropriate treatment for syphilis.\\\\nShe was started on Fluconazole 1000 mg daily to treat CNS infection with Coccidioides as well as Penicillin G 4 million units IV every 4 hours for 14 days to treat neurosyphilis.Unfortunately, her mental status continued to decline requiring intubation for airway protection.On Day 20, she underwent external ventricular drain (EVD) placement due to worsening hydrocephalus on repeat imaging.Subsequent imaging on Day 22 showed worsening ventriculomegaly with bifrontal hemorrhage despite EVD placement ().Due to lack of neurological improvement and poor prognosis, her family elected to transition to comfort-focused care, and she was discharged on a hospice on Day 30.', 'A 55 year-old male was diagnosed with stage IIIB (T4bN1aMx) superficial spreading melanoma of the right distal thigh after initial surgery, right inguinal SLN biopsy and right inguinal CLND.He was treated with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks and received 2 doses.Following second dose, he developed parasthesias in distal lower extremities bilaterally that subsequently ascended to involve proximal lower extremities, then upper extremities along with weakness and loss of deep tendon reflexes.No bladder or bowel incontinence and/or difficulties with speech were observed.MRI brain and whole spine revealed abnormal enhancement involving the bilateral 5th, 7th and 8th cranial nerves, cauda equina nerve roots as well as the conus surface and peripheral nerves at the thoracolumbar junction (Fig.', 'A girl aged five years presented with fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting of one day’s duration.She had a recurrence of acute uncomplicated appendicitis.This girl had had her first episode two years previously, when she had acute appendicitis with an appendicular mass.She was treated conservatively with antibiotics; however, Patient 6 once again was treated non-surgically.In her case, the COVID-19 infection presumably exacerbated the course of appendicitis and resulted in abdominal pain.', 'A 29-year-old female patient, gravida 1, para 1, with no significant pathological history, had presented herself in consultation complaining of a left cervical swelling that had been evolving for 11 months in a context of general state conservation.The mass was increased in size rapidly after the end of the breastfeeding period (three months).The clinical examination at admission found normal vital signs, and Body mass index of 26.3 kg/m2.Family history was unremarkable for cancer.The patient was used a combined oral contraceptive for menstrual regulation.\\\\nThe cervical examination showed a postero-lateral mass of the left neck measuring 6 cm in diameter, painless, of firm consistency, unilobed, soft, adherent to the superficial and deep plane.There was no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy or inflammatory signs of the adjacent skin.\\\\nA cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, revealing a mass of the left posterior cervical soft parts, at the expense of the trapezium muscle, tissue, oval, of regular contours, well-defined, measuring 41 × 68 × 81 mm, enhanced after injection of Gadolinium, with multiple homolateral supraclavicular and lateral cervical lymph nodes ().', 'A 68-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital on December 2, 2020, due to being “anxious and easily frightened for 3 months, psychomotor retardation, and affected by urinary incontinence for half a month.” The patient had no mental illness before and developed symptoms 3 months before admission.These included waking up early, being nervous and afraid for no apparent reason, and being fearful of leaving the house.The patient was upset, sensitive, and cried occasionally.In addition, the patient needed walking support (e.g., hands on the wall) at home to prevent falling.The patient had been hospitalized at a local mental health center 2 months prior to the present admission, where she was diagnosed with “GAD.” She received paroxetine (20 mg/d), tandospirone (30 mg/d), and oxazepam (15 mg/d).Her symptoms improved, and so she was discharged.She reported that she took the medications regularly according to the instructions.However, half a month prior to admission at our hospital, the patient experienced a relapse characterized by anxiety, fear, small steps while walking, reluctance to come out of her home, speaking less, and being slow to respond, as well as urinary incontinence.In addition, her social skills declined significantly, and the patient could not take care of herself independently.The patient had been diagnosed with type-II diabetes 4 years previously.No other comorbidities were reported.The patient had no abnormalities in her personal history, menstrual history, marriage and childbirth history, or family history.\\\\nPhysical examination after admission revealed she had normal limb muscle strength and tone.The finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movement, heel-to-shin tests, and Romberg’s sign were normal.However, her gait was not stable and she took small steps.She was negative for pathological signs and meningeal irritation.In a psychological assessment, the patient exhibited clear consciousness, disorientation to place and time, passivity during interactions with few answers to questions, no hallucinations or delusions, a decline in memory and cognition; and a reduction in daily physical activities and energy levels.She felt distraught with a slight tremor in her hands.\\\\nHer level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 6.280 µIU/mL (0.270-4.200); and she was normal for total T3, total T4, free T3, and free T4.Her level of anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-Tg) was 235.60 IU/mL (<115.00), and that of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO) was 238.70 IU/mL (<34.00).A color Doppler ultrasound showed diffused thyroid lesions with nodular changes (nodules in the right lobe of the thyroid).Both a CT examination (Figure ) and an MRI (Figure ) of the head showed brain atrophy and leukoaraiosis.', 'A 48-year-old woman presented with a 5-year history of intense pruritus and rash significantly impacting her daily life.Examination showed few excoriated papules and subtle lichenification on the upper back, elbows, dorsal forearms, thighs, and fingers.Biopsy revealed mild epidermal spongiosis with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate containing rare eosinophils, consistent with DHR ().After failing multiple therapies including topical betamethasone, topical tacrolimus, and oral mycophenolate mofetil, dupilumab was initiated with improvement in severity and duration of flares within the first 6 months.Due to slight progression of her baseline blurry vision and headaches, the dose was decreased to 200 mg every 2 weeks.The patient experienced subsequent flaring of her rash, so the dose was increased back to 300 mg every 2 weeks with resolution of her pruritus and rash and no further exacerbation of her ocular symptoms.Ultimately her ocular symptoms were evaluated by an ophthalmologist and deemed to not be consistent with dupilumab-induced conjunctivitis nor glaucoma.', 'A 34 year old woman from the east of Morocco, married and mother of two children, was admitted to the emergency room with intense periumbilical and pelvic abdominal pain associated with acute vomiting without any notion of metrorrhagia.The clinical examination revealed a conscious patient with an irreducible and impulsive painful mass at the umbilical level reminiscent of a strangulated inguinal hernia ().We performed an abdominal ultrasound scan which showed an evolving mono-fetal pregnancy; with an estimated weight of 1 kg, and a normal amount of amniotic fluid; strangulated through an umbilical orifice ().Faced with this exceptional diagnosis, the case was quickly discussed in a multidisciplinary team and the decision was made to perform an MRI.', 'A 14-year-old male adolescent presented to the emergency department with subfebrile temperatures for 1 week and localized pain in his right popliteal fossa for 3 days.Prior to the onset of these symptoms, he had been immobilized for several days following a minor sports injury.\\\\nThe adolescent had no permanent medication and no prior medical history except for an asymptomatic ATD diagnosed at the age of six by functional antithrombin assay (antithrombin activity of 57%, age adapted reference: 77–125%).Since at that time, there were no clinical signs of thrombosis, the diagnosis of ATD did not lead to any therapeutic consequences.Screening for ATD at this early age had been carried out on parental request, as his mother was diagnosed with ATD in her early adulthood.Interestingly, his mother now reported that she had very recently been diagnosed with IVCA (preexisting chromogenic test results showed an antithrombin activity of 50% for the mother, the age adjusted reference range being 80 to 130%).\\\\nThe coexistence of other hereditary thrombophilic disorders in our patient and his mother (protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin-mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome) was ruled out by respective laboratory analyses.\\\\nLaboratory blood analysis in the emergency department showed markedly elevated D-dimers of 25 mg/l FEU (reference: < 0.5 mg/l FEU) and of C-reactive protein (CrP) of 184 mg/l (reference < 5 mg/l).Antithrombin activity on admission was reduced to 61% (age adjusted reference 83–118%).\\\\nA vascular ultrasound examination upon admission confirmed the clinically suspected thrombosis of the right lower extremity involving the external iliac, common and superficial femoral as well as the popliteal vein.The ultrasound examination of the left lower extremity veins did not give evidence of thromboses upon admission.The patient was treated with continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin at a therapeutical dose including several bolus administrations and antithrombin (4000 IE within the first 36 h) was substituted reaching levels in the target range between 80 and 100%.Subsequent monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) showed an insufficient response to heparin treatment (aPTT was 29 s before the administration of heparin and did not exceed a maximum value of 33.6 s during heparin treatment).The anticoagulative therapy was therefore switched to direct thrombin inhibition by argatroban at a dose of 1.5–2.0 μg/kg/min, which led to target aPTT values of 50–60s.\\\\nDue to the elevated CrP levels and subfebrile temperatures, empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous cefuroxim was initiated.\\\\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on day three confirmed a complete DVT of the right lower extremity, and now additionally extended thromboses of the left lower extremity and thrombosis of both iliac vessels.', 'In December 2020, an 83-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital with a large ulcerated and necrotic bulging lesion on her forehead.Ill-defined, dusky erythematous plaques extended on the parietal and frontal areas of the scalp and the face.Violaceous-darkish nodules were also observed.Comorbidities included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic encephalopathy.The physical examination revealed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy.\\\\nThe patient’s relatives provided photographic documentation of the evolution.The lesion had emerged four months before admission as a 2 cm bruise-like patch on the forehead (a), before it rapidly developed into a large purplish plaque after 1 month (b), and then to the current presentation (c).\\\\nThe second lockdown in Italy and the fear of the SARS-CoV-2 contagion had led the relatives to postpone the medical evaluation.A biopsy from a violaceous nodule showed a full dermal proliferation of irregular anastomosing vascular channels lined by single or double layers of enlarged endothelial cells, which permeated between collagen bundles, causing “collagen dissection” (a,b).The endothelial cells were large and pleomorphic, with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli, and were immunoreactive for CD31, CD34 and ERG (c,d), with no observed HHV8 expression or MYC overexpression.\\\\nThese data confirmed the diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the scalp.All routine investigations were normal.Total body computed tomography (CT) showed cervical lymphadenopathy without brain or visceral metastases.Although radiotherapy and electrochemotherapy were considered, they were not performed due to the patient’s advanced age, comorbidities, and tumor size.The patient was referred to palliative care.', 'A 34-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 3) with three spontaneous vaginal deliveries was transferred to the Ulsan University Hospital from a local clinic due to severe abdominal pain accompanied by right flank pain.The patient had been previously healthy and had no specific medical or surgical history.She had an irregular menstruation cycle, and her last menstruation occurred five weeks and six days previously.The initial vital signs at the emergency room were stable; systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 114 mmHg and 68 mmHg, respectively.The initial pulse rate was 71 beats per minute.Whole abdominal tenderness with muscle guarding was noted on physical examination.Blood tests showed a low hemoglobin level (10.7 g/dL).A urinary pregnancy test was positive, and the serum β-HCG level was 7377.0 mIU/mL.Gynecological sonography found no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy, except for normal bilateral adnexa with free fluid collection, suggestive of hemoperitoneum.After eight hours, the follow up blood test showed a lower hemoglobin level (8.6 g/dL).Two packs of packed red blood cells were transfused.We suspected a ruptured ectopic pregnancy through elevated serum β-HCG, but the ectopic mass could not be identified on pelvic ultrasound.Thus, we planned abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT) to determine the cause of the right frank pain.Approximately 2 cm hypervascular mass in the subphrenic region, with a moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, was revealed (), which was thought to be the cause of the bleeding.Because of suspicions of a diaphragmatic ectopic pregnancy or other ruptured unknown hepatic mass, she was admitted for emergency surgery.Diagnostic laparoscopic surgery was performed in collaboration with a hepatobiliary surgeon and an obstetrician-gynecologist.On laparoscopy, about 400 mL of blood and clots were aspirated from the pelvic cavity, but both adnexa appeared normal.Approximately 20 × 10 cm tissue, suspected to be the placenta with a hematoma, had covered the diaphragm.After the removal of the placenta-like tissues, we found a 2 cm hypervascular mass attached to the diaphragm ().The mass was completely resected from the diaphragm and sent for histological examination.After the surgical mass removal, the patient was discharged without any postoperative complications, and the serum β-HCG level normalized within a month.The final pathologic diagnosis indicated that the mass was a product of conception, consistent with an ectopic pregnancy ().', 'A 24-year-old Sri Lankan man developed fever, profuse vomiting and diarrhoea followed by reduced level of consciousness over a 12-h duration.He had myalgia, arthralgia and frontal headache.He did not have photophobia, phonophobia, skin rash, fits, cough or urinary symptoms.He did not have any bleeding manifestations.He did not smoke tobacco or consume alcohol.There was no history of illicit drug abuse or high risk sexual behavior.He had been previously diagnosed with mild intermittent bronchial asthma.\\\\nOn examination, he was febrile (101.3 °F), drowsy with a Glasgow coma scale of 11/15.There were no skin rashes or lymphadenopathy.No focal signs were noted in the neurological examination and fundoscopic examination was normal.His Pulse rate was 112 bpm; blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg with no postural hypotension; respiratory rate was 14/min.Rest of the general and systems examinations were normal.\\\\nHis full blood count on admission showed white blood cells of 6 × 109/L (Normal range [NR] 4.0–11.0 × 109/L) with neutrophils of 59%; haemoglobin 14.3 g/dL (NR 13.5–16.5 g/dL) and platelet count of 74 × 109/L (NR 150–450 × 109/L).Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 13 mm in first hour and C-reactive protein was 63 mg/l (NR < 5 mg/L).Serum electrolytes were normal with mild impaired renal function.Liver enzymes were elevated, alanine aminotransferase was 303 U/l (NR < 50 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase was 482 U/l (NR < 50 U/L) with a total bilirubin of 10.6 µmol/L (NR 5–21 µmol/L).His urine analysis and coagulation profile were normal.Non-contrast CT brain demonstrated cerebral oedema.Lumbar puncture was precluded by a low platelet count.\\\\nBased on a working diagnosis of encephalitis, he was commenced on intravenous meropenem, vancomycin, aciclovir and dexamethasone, but were subsequently omitted once the diagnosis became evident.\\\\nOn further investigation, dengue IgM antibody in serum was positive on day 6 of fever.Blood and urine cultures did not yield any microbial growth.Electroencephalography showed generalized slow wave activity.The cranial MRI showed an isolated ovoid hyperintensity in the splenium of the corpus callosum with homogeneous hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (Fig.', 'A 35-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia and seizure disorder presented to an outside hospital following a breakthrough seizure, where he was incidentally also found to have punctate areas of acute cerebral infarcts in multiple vascular territories.Additional workup revealed the presence of a left atrial thrombus and newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation.He was ultimately discharged to home on apixaban.The patient then re-presented a month later for evaluation of transient diplopia, expressive aphasia, daily right temporal headaches, and right facial and left leg weakness.MRI of the brain showed new areas of diffusion restriction in the left cerebellar hemisphere and left medial occipital lobe (Figure ).', 'A previously healthy right-handed 24-year-old woman developed a headache three days before admission in the left frontal region with an 8/10 intensity accompanied by retro-ocular pain and phosphenes.Twenty-four hours later, she developed a speech disorder and was presented to the emergency department.Upon arrival, her blood pressure was normal (110/70 mmHg), tachycardic with a heart rate of 94 beats per minute, normal respiratory rate (14 breaths per minute) and temperature (36.2°C).The neurological examination showed normal mental status, with fluent speech and no paraphasias.The patient had normal nomination, and she was able to understand and obey simple commands.She was able to read-out loud and write, but could not repeat simple phrases; the rest of the examination was normal.Her blood work revealed hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL and 4,390 leukocytes mm3/mL, human immunodeficiency virus type one and two antibodies detection were negative; rest of the blood work was normal.A chest X-ray was performed and it revealed generalized symmetrical interstitial infiltrates.Acontrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain showed multiple edematous nodular lesions in the left parietal lobe and cerebellum on the T1-weighted sequence (Figure ).\\\\nTransthoracic echocardiogram, carotid and vertebral Doppler ultrasound examination were normal.', 'A 56-year-old male patient with no known comorbidities presented to the emergency department with history of fever and headache for past 2 days with sporadic episodes of projectile vomiting, irrelevant talk, and poor sensorium for a day.On admission, the patient manifested fever (39 °C), a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30/min, and capillary blood glucose of 140 mg/dl.His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 9, with respective scores of 5, 2, and 2 for motor, eye, and verbal responses.There were no signs of meningeal irritation or focal neurological deficit.Clinical examination was otherwise normal except for a scar over the anterior bi-frontal region which was a surgical incision.On further inquiry, he had an accidental fall from a two-story building 23 years ago, causing a persistent CSF leak from the nose (rhinorrhea).He underwent complete repair for the CSF leak without any residual defect.There were no further hospitalizations for the past 23 years with symptoms suggestive of meningitis.\\\\nHis computerized tomography (CT) scan showed cystic gliosis changes in the left frontal lobe which was communicating with the frontal horn of ipsilateral lateral ventricle.CSF analysis of the patient revealed hypoglycorrachia (< 20 mg/dl with corresponding blood sugar of 140 mg/dl), elevated protein > 300 mg/dl, and neutrophil-predominant pleocytosis (total cells 360/mm3 with 96% polymorphs) suggestive of acute pyogenic meningitis.He was started empirically on ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg/day in two divided doses, amoxycillin 100 mg/kg/day in four divided doses, and acyclovir 45 mg/kg/day in three divided doses.Initial peripheral blood WBC count was 14,760 with 85% neutrophils and serum lactate levels of 5.35 mmol/l.His renal and liver function tests were normal.Antibiotics (ceftriaxone, amoxycillin) were continued, and acyclovir was stopped as there were filamentous gram-negative rods in gram staining of the CSF, which was a rare morphology to be identified (Fig.).Further, the sample was plated onto blood agar, MacConkey agar, and chocolate agar and incubated aerobically at 37 °C.Non-hemolytic colonies were formed on blood agar (Fig.) which were lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey agar (Fig.).The organism was identified to be Escherichia coli by Vitek 2 Compact (Biomerieux), and spectrum of antibiotic sensitivity was described in Table .\\\\nIn accordance with the culture and sensitivity pattern, ceftriaxone was continued and amoxycillin was stopped.He was afebrile for the next 48 h, and his sensorium improved.Further work up was done to identify the source of seeding of E.coli to the meninges.Urine culture and blood cultures that were sent prior to initiation of antibiotics did not show any bacterial growth, and stool microscopy was negative for ova and cysts.CT scan of the abdomen revealed a non-obstructive renal calculus of 6 mm × 6mm at interpole of the left kidney without any signs of pyelonephritis.After the initial improvement, patient again had a drop in sensorium without any localizing signs.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast study was done to rule out secondary complications associated with meningitis like vascular infarcts or hydrocephalus.', \"The patient was a 2-year-old boy from Russian republic of Ingushetia.Both parents and younger sibling (female) were asymptomatic.Family history is not burdened.Parents may be related, as the mother of the child and the grandmother (father's line) are from neighboring villages of Malgobek region of Ingushetia.\\\\nThe patient is the first child of healthy parents.Pregnancy proceeded against the background of gestosis in the first and second trimester, threats of interruption for a period of 12 weeks, anemia, and lack of hydration.The child was born as a result of fast unassisted childbirth.His birth weight was 3570 g and height was 55 cm.Apgar scores were 6/7.Early motor development slightly delays: He attained head holding at 3 months, sitting without support at 6 months, by the year the boy got up and walked with support.From the age of 8 months, the baby had a weight loss of 2 kg for 2 months with episodes of repeated vomiting.At the age of 1 year 2 months against a background of acute respiratory viral infection, there was a regress in development—the boy stopped walking.Subsequently, rachitic skeletal changes, an increase in the volume of the abdomen appeared, and a loss of motor skills progressed.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed a mildly expressed leukopathy in white matter of parietal lobes.\", 'Our patient is a 43-year-old ambidextrous male with a 20-year history of intractable seizures.His seizure semiology typically included a hot flash and other sensory auras with evolution into focal motor activity predominately on the right.Workup for seizure etiology included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealing the large midline lipoma, partial callosal agenesis, and an adjacent lesion in the left frontal lobe presumed to represent a glial neoplasm based on the radiographic appearance.', 'This is a case of 41-month-old infant girl who presented with weight loss and intractable diarrhea associated with oral feeding.She is a product of full-term pregnancy, delivered through spontaneous vaginal delivery, with a birth weight of 2 kg, and she did not require admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).The pregnancy was uneventful.Parents are first-degree cousins, and the patient has two older healthy siblings.\\\\nAt the age of six months, she presented to another hospital afebrile with a loss of weight and had watery, non-bloody diarrhea, six to seven times per day.Both endoscopy and biopsy from the duodenum were normal according to the mother.The patient was initially misdiagnosed with cow milk protein allergy, so hypoallergenic formula was given but there was no improvement, then after two months, she was switched to amino acid-based infant formula 200 ml five times per day.In the beginning, there was an improvement, but with time, she stopped gaining weight again.At the age of 10 months, she came to the gastroenterology and genetics teams at our facility with chronic diarrhea, poor growth, and abnormal hair.Her weight and height were 5.30 kg (<3rd percentile) and 61 cm (<3rd percentile), respectively.The diagnosis of THES was confirmed by whole exons sequence (WES) analysis, which identified the homozygous variant (c.1201G > A) p.(Glu401Lys) in the SKIV2L gene.Upon literature review, we did not find the mentioned variant mutation in any previous literature (Table ).\\\\nAt 12 months of age, she was admitted for dehydration and nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding due to poor weight gain.Her body measurements upon admission were 5.64 kg (<3rd percentile) for the weight, and her height was 63 cm (<3rd percentile).Upon examination, she had some dysmorphic features such as a depressed nasal bridge, broad forehead, low set ears, and scanty dry hair.During her admission, she was having watery diarrhea with mucus two to three times a day.She was managed with intravenous fluid and the clinical nutritionist prepared a high-calorie formula.The nutrition therapy plan was to provide 180 ml of hypoallergenic baby formula (0.67 kcal/ml) every four hours orally, as much as she can tolerate, and if she did not complete her meal, give the rest through the NGT.This plan provided her with 192 ml/kg fluids and 135 kcal/kg/day energy.Her laboratory workup results were sodium 138 mmol/l, potassium 3 mmol/l, chloride 113 mmol/l, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 40 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 30 units/l, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 32 units/l.Her immunoglobulins workup showed low immunoglobulin E <25 au/ml, and normal immunoglobulin G and A levels.She was improving and gained 100 grams in two days.On the seventh day of admission, she was able to tolerate oral feeding, so the patient was discharged on the same plan and to add 1 ml of medium-chain triglycerides oil every other day.\\\\nAt the age of 21 months, the mother reported in a follow-up visit that her daughter’s weight has been improved and reached 7.8 kg, but still under the third percentile.The patient was continued on hypoallergenic baby formulas and a regular diet.At the age of 41 months, the patient presented with progressive bullous itchy skin rash, and fluid-filled vesicles on erythematous background with red erosions and fissures all over the body but sparing abdomen and back.It was associated with cough, rhinorrhea, fever, and decreased urine output and oral intake, but without gastrointestinal complications.The diagnosis of bullous impetigo was made, and the patient was admitted.Amoxicillin, clavulanate, and diphenhydramine were administered intravenously with topical clindamycin and tretinoin cream.The patient showed clinical improvement in three days.The patient was discharged on oral Augmentin, Mupirocin, and Loratadine (Figure ).\\\\nOn follow-up evaluation at the age of 41 months, her weight and height were 10 kg (<3rd percentile) and 85 cm (<3rd percentile), respectively.She was able to tolerate normal oral feeding.She did not show any signs of intellectual disability, and she is developmentally up to her age now.She is active and plays with her cousins.She can speak and understand both Arabic and English, and according to the mother she is starting to memorize songs.', 'The patient is a 46-year-old right-handed female with a past medical history of hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), diabetes mellitus type two (DM2), obesity, and hemorrhagic stroke who was transferred from an outside facility to be evaluated for CNS vasculitis.She was admitted to this outside facility for a four-week period prior to being transferred to the primary facility for further evaluation over a subsequent 23-day period.Total duration of hospitalization at both the facilities was close to 7.5 weeks.Approximately one week into the initial four-week admission, her family found that she was very lethargic with diminished responsiveness and pronounced difficulty speaking.In the emergency room (ER), her blood pressure was measured at 243/129 mmHg with a blood glucose value greater than 400 mg/dL.She was started on aggressive antihypertensive therapy and underwent a series of diagnostic tests.Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated in combination with high-dose atorvastatin.With respect to her lethargy and fluctuating cognition, there was concern that she may be experiencing complex partial seizures, so lacosamide was also started.\\\\nA baseline computed tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast showed multiple indeterminate lacunar infarcts involving the head of the right caudate nucleus and left corona radiata.The same day, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and elicited similar findings with the addition of bilateral punctate infarcts of the left thalamus, right periventricular white matter, and right centrum semiovale.', 'A 60-year-old white unmarried man with chronic schizophrenia fell to the floor and was unable to get up or walk.When examined he had an asymmetrical smile and apparent paresis of his left leg.He was hospitalized with a tentative diagnosis of stroke.\\\\nFrom his relatives we learned that he had grown up in a village on the Norwegian coastline as the fourth of five siblings.He did not excel at school, and started at an early age to work in the local fishing industry.He held the job until at the age of 30 he moved to another part of the country.There he worked as a custodian at a hotel.At age 37 he went back to his home village to live close to his compassionate family of origin.He was then employed as an assistant custodian (supported employment) in the local fishing industry until he was 56-years old.He was treated for psychotic symptoms on-and-off from his mid-twenties.He was not diagnosed as having schizophrenia until he was 40-years old.Since then he received out-patient psychiatric treatment until the present illness occurred.At the age of 55, diabetes mellitus type 2 was diagnosed.Osteoporosis was diagnosed 2–3 months prior to the present illness.\\\\nThis was the first time he had been hospitalized.His family members said that he had had swallowing problems, difficulties with speech, and unsteady gait for the last 4–5 years.This information was corroborated by our patient’s general practitioner.He had deteriorated physically over the last 3–4 months with increased fatigue.He had developed general inertia and was easily exhausted after a short period of physical labor.He had developed hypersomnia, with 10–12 hours of sleep per night, a weight loss of 4–5 kg, and an unsteady gait.To descend the stairs he preferred to sit on his buttocks and slide down the staircase one step at a time until reaching the lower floor.He had been a heavy tobacco smoker for several decades.His alcohol use was modest.\\\\nHis main psychiatric symptoms before being hospitalized were social withdrawal and delusions about several small persons, the size of dolls, attached to his body.Furthermore, he had auditory and visual hallucinations.He was very reluctant to talk about the contents of the, probably imperative, auditory hallucinations.Antipsychotic medication, risperidone tablets, was first started in 1997.A year later the medication was switched to olanzapine tablets.The dosage varied between 7.5 and 15 mg per day without any objective or subjective side effects.There had been no unambiguous extrapyramidal side effects.\\\\nOn physical examination, he was alert and orientated, but in some pain in his left hip and knee.He was afebrile with a body temperature (ear) of 37.4 °C, blood pressure was 136/83 mmHg, he had a regular pulse rate at 82 per minute, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) was 97%.Auscultation of his carotid arteries revealed no bruits.His heart rhythm was regular without any pulse deficit.There were no heart murmurs.A lung examination was suboptimal as inspiration was weak.It was possible that some crackles could be heard bilaterally at the base of his lungs.A neurological examination revealed impaired tongue wiggling when tested for quick side-to-side movements, dysarthria, symmetrically reduced muscle force (5−/4+) in his upper extremities, reduced force in his left leg (not quantified), and asymmetrical plantar reflexes (downward movement on the right side, indifferent on the left).His regular medication before admission was olanzapine tablets 12.5 mg/day (7.5 mg + 5 mg), metformin tablets 500 mg three times a day, calcium/cholecalciferol 500 mg/400 IU tablets two times a day, and paracetamol 500 mg two times a day.His complete blood count was normal: hemoglobin (Hgb) was 14.0 g/dL, hematocrit was 0.44, his white blood cell count was 8.2 × 109/L, his platelet count was 275 × 109/L, his neutrophil count was 5.6 × 109/L, his lymphocyte count was 1.5 × 109/L, his monocyte count was 0.7 × 109/L, his eosinophil count was 0.4 × 109/L, and his basophil count was < 0.1 × 109/L.The only pathological tests from the chemistry panel were a low creatinine level of 59 μmol/L (reference range, 60–105), a high glucose level of 10.0 mmol/L (reference range, 4.0–6.0), a high glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 7.5% (reference range 4.3–6.1), a high alanine transaminase level of 94 U/L (reference range 10–70), and a high alkaline phosphatase level of 130 U/L (reference range 35–105).Urine, collected from a urine catheter on the day of admission, was delivered immediately to the microbiology laboratory in the same hospital building, and cultivated.There were > 100,000 bacteria per ml, identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis, probably representing contamination.There was no bacterial growth in a repeat urine test taken 3 days later.\\\\nThe day after admission a left dislocated hip fracture was identified.This information, in combination with a normal cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and disappearance of his facial asymmetry, caused the clinicians to reject the stroke hypothesis.', 'In July 2019, a 74-year-old male patient was admitted to the Infectious Disease Section of the Verona University Hospital for investigation; he had HBV in his blood with a titer of 26,100,000 IU/mL (cobas® HBV, Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ, USA) but exhibited normal liver function.Although he displayed the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), he was negative for the HBsAg, but positive for the homologous anti-HBs (ADVIA Centaur HBV assays, Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany).\\\\nIn August 2013, the patient received a kidney transplant for nephroangiosclerosis.At this time, the serologic screening for HBV had shown that he was HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs-positive (12 mIU/mL), HBeAg-negative and positive for antibodies to the HBeAg and to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc).No antibody markers of a hepatitis C and hepatitis D virus infection were detected; serum HBV DNA had not been determined.The indices of hepatic cytolysis were normal.The kidney donor was negative for HBV.Post-transplant, the patient received immunosuppressive induction with basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate and steroids, and was then included in the follow-up program as per protocol; the HBsAg remained negative throughout, accompanied by normal liver biochemistry.\\\\nIn May 2019, the patient developed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).Before treatment with imatinib mesylate, the patient repeated the HBV serology and the HBeAg was again detected in his blood in the absence of circulating HBsAg; further testing using a real-time PCR showed that he had HBV DNA in serum at a titer of 26,100,000 IU/mL.The patient was still anti-HBs-positive (15 mIU/mL) with normal liver enzymes.A diagnosis of HBVr was made and, in July 2019, the patient started entecavir (ETV) treatment at 0.5 mg/day, which was subsequently reduced in April 2020 to 0.5 mg/48 h because of renal function deterioration.The patient underwent a close follow-up (every 2 weeks) for the first 6 months of treatment and, after, with monthly scheduling.The therapy led to a consistent decrease in viremia, reaching a plateau of 3 Log10 HBV DNA reduction after 6 months of treatment (); however, viremia did not decrease further in the following months.No classic ETV-resistant mutations were observed in the HBV reverse transcriptase (rt) gene.However, we detected the mutation rtL269I, previously reported to confer a reduced susceptibility to ETV [].On January 2021, the patient switched to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) treatment; HBV DNA rapidly declined and reached a value of 378 IU/mL at the last FU.The single ALT elevation (107 U/L) in the 2nd month of TAF treatment was documented in the course of an infection of the residual left limb requiring surgical toileting.Unfortunately, the patient died from coronary heart disease in September 2021.\\\\nThe serum samples collected from July 2019 were tested for the HBsAg with the highly sensitive Lumipulse® G HBsAg-Quant assay (Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo, Japan) as well as for the HBcrAg (Lumipulse® G HBcrAg, Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo, Japan) [].The nucleotide sequences of the HBV S gene and the rt domain were determined using the Sanger sequencing method at BMR Genomics service (BMR Genomics, Padua, Italy) and analyzed using ClustalW2 software (; accessed on 23 December 2019 and on 6 December 2020) [].The HBV genotype was determined based on a reverse hybridization line probe assay (INNO-LiPA HBV Genotyping, Fujirebio Europe, Gent, Belgium) [].\\\\nDespite its high analytical sensitivity for HBsAg mutants [], the HBsAg assay failed to detect a circulating HBs antigen.The HBV S gene sequence analysis identified four mutations within the a-determinant (aa 124–147) (P/T127H, Q129N, F/Y134H and G145R) and five additional mutations within the mayor hydrophilic region (MHR, aa 99–169) (T116N, P120S, C121Y, K/R160S and W165S) ().The values of the HBcrAg from baseline to the end of the follow-up were persistently above the upper limit threshold of the assay (>7.0 Log10 U/mL).Viral genotyping showed that the patient was infected with HBV genotype D.', 'A 58-year-old Caucasian (American) male with an unremarkable past medical history presented for evaluation of nausea, vomiting, and a 30-pound weight loss over the past two months at our hospital.He also reported dark-colored urine and intermittent episodes of hemoptysis during the same period.Specifically, he stated that his symptoms started four days after receiving his second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine for COVID-19.His first dose taken three weeks earlier was well tolerated.He denied any flank or abdominal pain, melena, fever, cough, hematuria, urinary frequency or urgency, and trauma.He denied smoking.Vital signs were stable upon admission.Physical examination was insignificant for any lower extremity pitting edema, petechiae, or rash.The patient was not on any medication prior to his hospitalization.\\\\nLaboratory analysis was remarkable for serum creatinine of 4.1 mg/dL (0.8-1.4 mg/dL) along with hematuria and sub-nephrotic proteinuria of 1796 g/24 hours (<150 mg/24 hours).Our differential diagnosis at this point was wide including all nephritic syndromes given AKI, hematuria and proteinuria.All serological workup was subsequently sent.C-ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) were elevated 160 AU/mL (20-25 AU/mL) and anti-proteinase 3 (anti-PR3) antibodies were also elevated >100 EU/ mL (normal <3.5 EU/mL) (Table ).Immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was not performed.All previous routine laboratory parameters including urinalysis were within normal range.\\\\nHe underwent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest for evaluation of hemoptysis that showed a right upper lobe consolidation and moderate bilateral pleural effusion.\\\\nThe renal ultrasound was unremarkable.Renal biopsy was subsequently performed and showed acute, pauci immune, focal necrotizing, and diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis (Figures , ).\\\\nThe patient was diagnosed with anti-PR3-associated ANCA glomerulonephritis.He received intense immunosuppression with plasma exchange x 5 cycles, intravenous prednisone 1 gram x 3 doses followed by prednisone 60 mg daily, cyclophosphamide x 2 doses, and rituximab x 4 doses.The patient achieved remission after 10 weeks of diagnosis with a resolution of symptoms and improvement in renal function with a creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl.He is following in our nephrology office regularly since discharge.', 'Our patient is a 78-year-old male with a past medical history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides (on regular outpatient extracorporeal photopheresis), type II diabetes mellitus, atrial flutter on Xarelto, and sick sinus syndrome on dual-chamber pacemaker, presented to the hospital with right upper quadrant abdominal pain.The patient was a former smoker and denied any alcohol use.\\\\nIn the emergency department, he was hemodynamically stable.Laboratory workup was significant for abnormally elevated liver function tests including aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) of 204/188 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 550 U/L, and total bilirubin of 2.5 mg/dL.Ultrasound of the abdomen was negative for any focal liver or gallbladder lesions.There was no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilation.Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan was normal, and hence cholecystitis was ruled out.CT abdomen and pelvis and CT angiography of the chest were negative for acute pathology.As the patient had a pacemaker, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) could not be performed.Further laboratory evaluation for elevated liver enzymes, including viral hepatitis panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), iron panel, antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-mitochondrial antibody, alpha-1-antitrypsin antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and ceruloplasmin was negative.\\\\nGiven that the patient has a history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the important differential diagnosis included leukemic infiltration of the liver and adverse reaction to the prior chemotherapy.However, the patient received only a short course of the chemotherapeutic regimen mogamulizumab (due to insurance issues), and hence it was unlikely to cause this current clinical picture.Subsequently, a percutaneous liver biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis, which showed replacement of the normal liver parenchymal cells by high-grade tumor cells with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio (Figures -).The tumor cells showed positive immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 20 (CK20), synaptophysin, chromogranin, and negative for CK7, caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX-2), and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) (Figures -).All these features were suggestive of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.There was no evidence of leukemic infiltrates.As the patient had no evidence of MCC involvement of the skin, he was diagnosed with metastatic MCC of the liver of unknown primary.\\\\nHematology/Oncology and Dermatology was consulted.Considering the medical comorbidities, the patient and family opted for comfort care measures and were discharged home.', 'A 21-year-old male student presented to the emergency department with severe headache for 15 days, periorbital swelling, pain and double vision in the right eye for 10 days, fever for 7 days and left lower limb weakness for 5 days ().\\\\nHis past history was unremarkable, and no significant family history was found.The patient was conscious, oriented, febrile, and his vital parameters were normal.Severe ptosis was noticed in the right eye, although visual acuity was normal in both eyes.Fundoscopy was also normal in both eyes.All cranial nerve function was found to be normal.On examination of the lower limb, it was evident that the tone of the muscle was normal, with grade-4 muscle strength.The patient had a typical hemiplegic gait with foot drop due to the weakness of the flexor muscles of the leg and foot on the left side.Ocular movement was restricted on right lateral gaze.The patient’s eye lid was swollen, tender and fluctuant on palpation.Diagnostic nasal endoscopy (DNE) revealed bulging of the right lateral wall of the nose and mucopurulent discharge in the middle meatus.The oral cavity and oropharynx were normal, and examination of the neck revealed no palpable lymph node.Contrast enhanced computer tomography (CECT) of the nose and paranasal sinus demonstrated bilateral pan sinusitis with right subperiosteal abscess ().\\\\nAn MRI of the brain revealed ring-enhancement lesion in the parasagittal area of right frontal lobe without significant displacement of the midline ().\\\\nPrompt conservative treatment was started covering gram positive, negative and anaerobes, assuming an infective etiology.', 'A 4-year-old girl was referred to our tertiary hospital for the specialist evaluation of a non-specific cough, which was present for 6 weeks, associated with a right pulmonary mass.The physical examination was normal; on auscultation, diminished breath sounds were present on the right side of the lung.The medical history and growth were unremarkable.Chest radiograph revealed a mass located in the right upper lobe and the middle lobe of the right lung, with a central area of calcification (Figure ).Chest computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the chest radiograph findings; a solid, well-contoured, heterogeneous, mass was noted in the right upper lobe and middle lobe of the lung with an area of central calcification (Figure ).\\\\nNo lymphadenopathy was detected.Microscopy, culture and cytology of the sputum were unremarkable.\\\\nThe erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 10, haemoglobin was 11.6 g/dl and the leucocyte count was 8.8 × 109/L.The other serum haematological and biochemical results were normal.The serology of Echinococcus and Mantoux test were negative.\\\\nThe patient did not respond to antibiotics; therefore, surgical removal of the mass was performed.Thoracotomy performed on the right side showed a lesion in the lung parenchyma, extended to the upper and middle lobes.The differential diagnosis of congenital lesions of the lung was made.As there was no success with fine-needle aspiration in several cases, we decided to perform surgical resection.\\\\nThe lesion was resected and lobectomy of both upper lobe and middle lobe was also performed.No associated lymphadenopathy was noted.\\\\nMacroscopically, a well-circumscribed mass measuring 5.5 × 5.5 × 4 cm was present.The excised tumour had an osseous centre measuring 2 × 1 × 1 cm.From the histological point of view, the mass consisted of disorganization of the normal bronchoalveolar parenchyma, myofibroblastic cells and inflammatory cell infiltrates, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and histiocytes.In the centre of the lesion, a large ossification was found.\\\\nImmunohistochemistry revealed calponin antigens, SMA, desmin, P53, bcL2, CK, HMW, and, in several myofibroblastic cells, expression of ALK-1.It was negative for beta-catenin, cyclin D1, Myo-D1, S100p, CD34, CD99 and CD117.\\\\nThe histological and immunohistochemistry characteristics were compatible with an inflammatory myofibroblastic pseudotumor.\\\\nThe post-operative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged home after 2 weeks of surgery.The patient re-presented to the hospital 1 year after surgery.The child had normal daily activities, normal chest x-ray and no recurrences.', 'A 71-year-old man initially presented to clinic with right hip and low back pain with radiation to his posterior right thigh.He denied numbness, tingling, and weakness of his bilateral lower extremities.He had reproducible pain in the right SI joint region after SI joint provocative testing.A radiographic spine survey was unrevealing for a structural source of low back pain or radiculopathy.Preoperative imaging, including MRI, did reveal lumbarization of the S1 vertebra, mammillary bodies in the alar region, and a residual S1-S2 disc (Figure , ).', 'A 31-year-old Caucasian male presented to the ED with a 10-day history of progressively worsening symptoms that started with a sore throat and dysphagia.Five days after the development of initial symptoms, productive cough with orange-colored sputum began.His condition worsened four days before presentation, with the development of fever, chills, night sweats, significant diarrhea, emesis, and pleuritic chest pain.On initial presentation, the patient appeared ill and anxious.He was febrile with a temperature of 102° Fahrenheit, tachycardic with a heart rate of 118 beats per minute, and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 109/54 mmHg. On physical exam, he had a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.His neck was supple with absent lymphadenopathy and both lungs were clear to auscultation.Laboratory work on admission was remarkable for a leukocyte count of 23.2 x 10^9/Liter, a neutrophil count of 85.6% with 16% bands, serum sodium of 132 mmol/Liter, and a D-Dimer of 4.29 mg/L FEU.Initially, one gram of ceftriaxone and 500 mg of azithromycin were administered intravenously in the ED.Tests were then ordered including a monospot and rapid Streptococcus A antigen via pharyngeal swab, as well as (1,3)-beta-D-glucan and HIV-1 RNA via serum, and Legionella pneumophila urine antigen; all without remarkable findings.A complete viral respiratory panel was negative, and PCR did not detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae, SARS-CoV-2, or Chlamydia pneumoniae.A portable chest X-Ray performed in the ED demonstrated right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure 1).A CT angiogram of the chest ordered to rule out pulmonary embolus (Figures -) demonstrated no signs of acute pulmonary emboli.However, findings displayed a large consolidation in the right lower lobe and a 4 cm cavitation in the left lower lobe.Transthoracic ECG was then performed, demonstrating no vegetations or valvular abnormalities.Trans-esophageal ECG was recommended to the patient, but he declined.Next, a CT scan of the neck was ordered, showing no evidence of abnormalities.Without significant improvement in WBC count for three days and persistent fevers >100° Fahrenheit, his antibiotic regimen was escalated to three grams of ampicillin-sulbactam administered intravenously every six hours.This resulted in an improved WBC to 16.1 x 10^9/Liter the following day.The patient had no further fevers and reported improvement in pleuritic chest pain and dysphagia.On day five of hospitalization, the initial blood culture grew a single anaerobic gram-negative bacterium, F.necrophorum.The patient continued to show improvement without signs of fever, nausea, or vomiting.A repeat negative blood culture and final WBC count of 14.5 x 10^9/Liter was reported on day eight of hospitalization before the patient was discharged later that afternoon.He was discharged home in a stable condition with 500 mg of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid given orally every twelve hours for seven days and was instructed to follow up with his primary care physician in three weeks for a repeat CT scan of his chest to monitor the resolution of pulmonary lesions.', 'Fifty-seven-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and recently diagnosed stage IV moderately differentiated distal rectal adenocarcinoma with liver and lung metastasis status post second cycle of FOLFOX palliative chemotherapy 1 week ago was admitted with the primary complaint of hypertensive urgency with a severe headache, intractable nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea.At presentation, her blood pressure was 191/68.Examination did not show any focal neurological deficits.She was alert, awake, and oriented to time, place, and person; cranial nerves II–XII were intact; muscle power was five out of five bilaterally in upper and lower extremities; coordination was intact bilaterally; reflexes were 2+ bilaterally in upper and lower extremities; sensation was intact; and gait was normal.The case was discussed with oncologists who were of the view that symptoms may be due to hypertensive urgency versus BM (which are quite rare for CRC) or possible opiate withdrawal as the patient has been on high-dose opiates for her cancer-related pain.Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen-pelvis did not show any evidence of bowel obstruction.Imaging of the brain would be considered if the patient did not improve with medical therapy.The patient was started initially on IV hydralazine but over the next 8 h patient blood pressure remained uncontrolled despite successive antihypertensives (IV labetalol, PO amlodipine, PO clonidine, IV enalaprilat, transdermal clonidine, IV metoprolol, and eventually IV nicardipine drip), ranging from 185/98 to 230/111.Brain imaging was ordered due to continuous severe headache and refractory hypertension.CT scan of the brain without contrast showed 3.3 × 2.3 × 2.8 cm hyperdense rounded mass in the region of the left cerebellum with surrounding vasogenic edema and a 5–6-mm shift of the posterior midline toward the right.Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast showed left cerebellar lesion measuring 3.6 × 3.2 × 2.9 cm with high T1 signal intensity, low T2 signal intensity, and low gradient echo sequence signal intensity with peripheral and mild internal enhancement, and a significant amount of surrounding vasogenic edema, ipsilateral transtentorial herniation, and obliteration of the fourth ventricle ().', 'Lastly, case 3 was a 2-year-old boy who presented with hemoptysis.Clinical investigations were performed to rule out pulmonary tuberculosis and other infectious causes, and these all came back negative.Two years later, he was hospitalized twice for pneumonia while living abroad and probably was accompanied by pulmonary hemorrhage due to first onset of anemia.Hemoptysis recurred at the age of 3; therefore, he underwent a comprehensive work-up including lung biopsy, which confirmed pulmonary hemosiderosis.Although the patient had no history of cow’s milk allergy, milk avoidance and systemic corticosteroids were initiated.Oral milk provocation was attempted 1 year later by introducing cow’s milk and dairy products such as cheese and ice cream every day for 1 week; this led to increased sputum and pulmonary infiltrates on the chest radiograph ().As a result, this patient was diagnosed with Heiner syndrome.', 'Case 1: The first patient was a 79-year-old female individual with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and middle cerebral artery infarction.Blood pressure control and cardiac function were in good condition before surgery, and no neurological complications were observed.The patient’s pulmonary function test result was normal, although her chest X-ray revealed pneumonia in the right middle lobe, for which she had been treated.The patient underwent total hip arthroplasty under general anesthesia.Before the general anesthesia, monitoring using several modalities was instituted, including electrocardiography, a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, pulse oximeter, and bispectral index (BIS) monitor.The BIS was maintained at 40–60.Anesthesia was induced with propofol (2 mg/kg) and rocuronium (0.8 mg/kg), and intra-arterial cannulation was performed for continuous blood pressure monitoring.Approximately 20 min into the surgery, the patient’s oxygen (O2) saturation level dropped from 93.1% to 83.1%.While being ventilated at a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.4, her arterial blood gas showed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) dropped from 161.6 to 51.2. We increased the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 10 cm H2O and FiO2 to 1.0 and performed a recruitment maneuver; however, her O2 saturation level increased only temporarily and dropped again to 81%.Upon suspecting atelectasis due to a collapsed lung, we reversed muscle relaxation and induced spontaneous respiration.The O2 saturation level recovered to 90%, and we continued the surgery with spontaneous respiration.After surgery, the patient’s O2 saturation level recovered to the preoperative state of 98%.', 'Our case concerns a 48-year-old male with a history of syphilis and heterozygous AS sickle cell trait.Mantle cell lymphoma with multiple lymphomatous polyposis had been diagnosed based on a bone marrow biopsy.The patient received three cycles of R-Maxi CHOP and three cycles of R-High Dose-Ara-C (Nordic protocol\\\\n) with complete response on the CT scan.His peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were mobilized and harvested on his last cycle of R-High Dose Ara-C with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor.Seven months after his diagnosis and two months after his last chemoimmunotherapy, he underwent the BeEAM protocol for an autologous HCT, which consists of bendamustine 200 mg/m2 intravenously given on days –8 and –7, cytarabine 200 mg/m2 intravenously twice a day on days –6 to –3, etoposide 100 mg/m2 intravenously twice a day on days –6 to –3, and melphalan 140 mg/m2 intravenously on day –2.\\\\n He was only taking vitamin D supplements at the time.\\\\nBaseline laboratory workup was unremarkable, as shown in .On day –8, he began the BeEAM protocol and received his first dose of intravenous bendamustine 440 mg (200 mg/m2).He also received intravenous fluids as part of the BeEAM protocol.From day –6, his urine output, serum sodium and serum creatinine started to increase ().His urine output markedly increased from 3725 mL on day –8 to 7425 mL on day –3 and the serum creatinine increased from 75 µmol/L on day –7 to 155 µmol/L on day –3.His serum sodium also increased to a peak of 155 mmol/L on day –2.During this time, the patient only complained of mild nausea.Vital signs were stable.Forced diuresis with furosemide was suspended and oral hydration was optimized.\\\\nOn day –1, the patient started complaining of polyuria, nocturia and thirst.However, he could not drink, since he had severe mucositis and odynophagia due to his chemotherapy, which led him to be put on total parenteral nutrition a few days after.A nephrology consultation request was made.Laboratory studies revealed the following values: random urine sodium 56 mmol/L; random urine osmolality 307 mOsm/kg and specific urine gravity from urinalysis 1.006.Despite the normal range of urine osmolality, the nephrologist team suspected a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) along with concomitant dehydration in absence of other identified causes of polyuria.However, no water deprivation test or desmopressin challenge was done since the patient had developed an acute kidney injury (AKI), and required fluids for his hypernatremia and his upcoming HCT.After the HCT, the patient’s infusion was first switched to 0.45% sodium chloride and subsequently to dextrose 5%.Serum sodium levels showed little improvement while fluid balance improved but remained negative.On day 5, desmopressin 1 mcg was administered subcutaneously with no effect on diuresis.The following day, a desmopressin (4 mcg) challenge was administered intravenously and showed a 33% increase from baseline urine osmolality of 204 mOsm/kg to an average of 277 mOsm/kg with a decrease in diuresis.These values were compatible with a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus.The patient remained polyuric and highly dependent on fluids due to his hypernatremia.Since he was partially responsive to the desmopressin challenge, intranasal desmopressin was started on day 8.The dose was increased until it reached desmopressin 40 mcg twice daily intranasally on day 11 ().A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was then performed on day 12 to rule out central lymphomatous infiltrates, which came back negative and therefore reinforced a diagnosis of partial NDI.', 'This was a 43-year-old woman with cervical carcinoma who received pelvic exenteration.Continuous intravenous infusion of oxycodone at 30 mg/day was started to relieve postoperative pain.The dose was increased in a stepwise way to 288 mg/day (MED 576 mg/day).The pain gradually subsided, and the oxycodone dose was reduced ().Continuous intravenous infusion was discontinued at 18 mg/day (6.25% of the maximum administered dose).However, six hours after discontinuation, she developed restlessness and an itching sensation in her legs.Therefore, continuous intravenous infusion of oxycodone at a dose of 18 mg/day was resumed the same day, and symptoms disappeared.The oxycodone dose was further reduced and discontinued gradually over 10 days.Subsequently, no withdrawal symptoms occurred.', 'The patient was a 5 year-old girl from Russia.She had unremarkable perinatal, neonatal and family history (parents and brother are clinically healthy).\\\\nShe was born from the fifth pregnancy, the second childbirth and was delivered by Caesarean section.Her birth weight was 3800 g and height was 53 cm.Apgar scores were 8 and 8 at 1 and 5 min respectively.No abnormalities were noted in neonatal period.Up to 2.5 years the girl developed according to her age without delay of speech and motor development.At the age of 2,5 years against a background of trauma of little finger, girl stopped talking.Gradually speech was restored, but vocabulary decreased.At 3 years the first febrile seizure attack occurred.Later parents noticed significant deterioration in her speech and communication.She became socially withdrawn.Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse lesions in the white matter and hypoplasia of the lower cerebellar vermis.At the age of 3, 5 years stereotypic movements appeared.From 3, 5 years patient was commenced on valproic acid (antiepileptic drug).But motor deterioration progressed: by the age of 5 she stopped walking.\\\\nBased on observed symptoms, diagnosis of Rett syndrome was suggested.Prior to clinical exome sequencing the following studies were carried out: measurement of palmitoyl protein thioesterase (PPT) level in leukocyte, tandem mass spectroscopy, sequencing of MeCP2 and TPP1, analysis of common mitochondrial DNA mutations.All studies showed no abnormalities.\\\\nAt the age of 5 years 8 months she was admitted to Scientific and Practical Center of Pediatric Psychoneurology with motor and mental deterioration, visual impairment and stereotypies.\\\\nShe had normal physical development: she was 20, 5 kg in weight and 111 cm in height.Head was normal shape, head circumference was 50, 5 cm (normal).The skin was normal and clean.Abdomen was soft, painless.Stool and micturition were normal.Basic blood and urine tests were normal.\\\\nThere was no interest in environment, no play activity.Orientation in space and time was absent.Speech and understanding of speech is disturbed: she used only speech sounds and syllables.She had stereotypic movements of hands and face.The girl have myoclonus in her hands, legs and facial muscles.Tactile stimulation enhances myoclonus.She does not walk, does not stand, does not crawl.A girl can only hold her head, roll over, sit with periodic falls.\\\\nOphthalmological evaluation revealed partial atrophy of optic nerves, nistagmus, retinitis pigmentosa and mixed astigmatism.\\\\nEEG (electroencephalography) revealed a significant delay in the formation of cortical electrogenesis and poorly-structured epileptiform activity in the occipital-parietal-posterior temporal regions.\\\\nMRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) revealed cortical atrophy, periventricular leukopathy of both hemispheres of the brain and atrophy of the cerebellum (Fig.', 'A 55-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of cerebral palsy (CP) presented with nausea, vomiting, thirty-pound weight loss, and worsening bilateral lower extremity weakness for one month.A computerized tomography (CT) angiogram of the brain revealed a suprasellar mass facilitating transfer to our institution for further management.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain indicated abnormal enhancement along the ependymal margin of the frontal horns of the bilateral lateral ventricles with four distinct abnormal enhancing mass lesions in the hypothalamus (11 × 12 × 13 mm), pineal gland (8 × 8 × 9 mm), the trigon of the right lateral ventricle (5 × 5 × 4 mm), and the foramen of Magendie (7 × 6 × 9 mm) which demonstrated restriction diffusion indicating hypercellularity ().\\\\nAn endoscopic biopsy of the third ventricle floor lesion was performed with pathology revealing sheets of intermediate size monotonous lymphoid cells displaying high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio with dispersed chromatin and indistinct nucleoli.', 'A 61-year-old woman was referred to our clinic complaining of an isolated, sudden, and painless visual loss in her right eye, within 24 h following a 2 h airplane flight (at 30,000 feet) from Paris to Madrid.Her medical history showed well-controlled hypercholesterolemia.\\\\nTwenty-four hours later, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/200 in her right eye (RE) and 20/20 in her left eye (LE).There was a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), color vison deficiency, and an inferior hemifield and temporal-superior quadrant scotoma (A) in the RE; funduscopic examination revealed a 360° swelling of the right optic disc, with superonasal flame-shaped hemorrhaging, venous congestion, and tortuosity.The LE was normal, with a cup-to-disc ratio of less than 0.1, suggesting “disc-at-risk”.Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) of the RE showed late optic-disc staining ().Cardiac and carotid Doppler ultrasound, autoimmune, and hypercoagulability tests were normal, with the exception of slightly raised serum cholesterol levels.Cranial computed tomography (CT) revealed previously unknown white matter lesions ().NA-AION associated with cerebral SVD was diagnosed.\\\\nAfter one year of treatment with aspirin (100 mg daily), the patient developed visual disturbances in her LE, occurring during a 10 days drive in the French Alps, with a daily accumulated altitude of 1500 m.BCVA was 20/200 in her RE and 20/40 in her LE.Examination revealed edematous and flame-shaped retinal hemorrhaging at the border of the left ONH, vascular tortuosity, fluorescein leakage (during FFA), and severe widespread visual field loss with central-sparing (B), suggesting a NA-AION in the LE.\\\\nAt the time of publication, BCVA had decreased to 20/200 in both eyes, fundus examination showed bilateral optic disc atrophy, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography had confirmed a marked decrease in peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in both eyes ().', 'A 54-year-old Caucasian female, without significant past medical history, unvaccinated for COVID-19 presented with shortness of breath, cough, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fevers a week starting with headache.Upon initial evaluation in the emergency room, vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP) was 115/77 mmHg, heart rate (HR) was 103 beats per minute (bpm), temperature was 99.0°F, and oxygen saturation was 84% on room air.Lab work showed nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2, elevated D-dimer (772 ng/mL), elevated international normalized ratio (INR) (1.3), hyperglycemia (117 mg/dL), hyponatremia (130 mmol/L), hypokalemia (3.3 mmol/L), hypochloremia (91 mmol/L), elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase {AST}: 157 U/L, alanine aminotransferase {ALT}: 87 U/L), elevated N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (508 pg/mL), and elevated troponin (13 ng/L).Chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates.CT chest with contrast showed bilateral pneumonia.The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit and started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, dexamethasone, and remdesivir.Initial EKG on admission showed sinus tachycardia and left axis deviation with HR of 101 bpm (Figure ).After three days of remdesivir, EKG was repeated and showed sinus bradycardia with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay, with HR of 57 bpm (Figure ).Third day after discontinuing remdesivir, the patient developed a transient arrhythmia noted on telemetry which resolved within a few seconds.This prompted nurse to get an EKG which showed normal sinus rhythm (Figure ).Potassium levels were low initially and after repletion potassium normalized on day two of hospital stay.Magnesium levels were normal throughout the hospital stay.', 'An 82-year-old male patient with angina on anticoagulant medication and without viral infection was referred to our department for the surgical treatment of HCC.His personal and family medical history was otherwise unremarkable.Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a huge HCC mass in segment 4 and PVTT invasion from the nearby portal vein to the left portal trunk, main portal trunk, through to the contralateral right portal trunk.The tip of the PVTT progressed over to the bifurcation of the anterior and posterior branches of the portal trunk.The anterior branch was filled with PVTT, while the posterior branch was filled with PVTT or blood thrombus (Fig.).No apparent intra- and extra-hepatic metastases were detected other than the main tumor.Laboratory data showed a serum albumin level of 3.8 g/dL, total bilirubin level of 0.5 mg/dL, platelet count of 13.9 × 104/uL, and a Child-Pugh score of 6.Serum levels of alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II were 90,770 ng/mL and 2847 mAU/mL, respectively.An antithrombotic drug was administered for the PVTT.Due to the overwhelming PVTT extensions, poor performance status, and old age, the patient was deemed not to have a surgical indication.Therefore, a combination treatment using atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with radiotherapy for PVTT was selected.During preparation for radiotherapy, one-time atezolizumab (1200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) were administered.He developed anal pain and persistent fever 9 days after administration, and CT showed perianal abscess due to anal fistula.Although he recovered soon after percutaneous abscess drainage, this adverse event interrupted atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, and radiotherapy could not be introduced.Abdominal CT, conducted 3 weeks after the first administration, showed size reduction of the main tumor and PVTT, with a reduction in tumor enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT.Serum AFP decreased from 90,700 ng/mL before treatment to 18,371 ng/mL and 6301 ng/mL 3 and 5 weeks after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, respectively.Considering the excellent response to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment (one-time administration), we decided to continue with this treatment after creating colostomy.Colostomy was performed 47 days after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.Subsequently, beginning from the 83rd day after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, atezolizumab monotherapy was initiated.The reason for choosing atezolizumab monotherapy was that the bleeding from the colostomy persists from the collateral blood circulation due to the liver cirrhosis.The serum AFP decreased to 89 ng/mL just before the next atezolizumab monotherapy, and abdominal CT showed continued partial response (Fig.); serum AFP levels kept decreasing toward the normal range (Fig.).He received a one-time atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment and continued with atezolizumab monotherapy afterward (9 regimens administered until now); there is no apparent sign of residual tumors at 9 months after the introduction of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment.', 'A 31-year-old man with no known medical history presented after being found down outside his home.On arrival at the emergency department (ED), he was lethargic but following commands without extremity weakness.Mild dysarthria was noted.His blood pressure in the ED was 121/57 mmHg. He was not taking any medications and the toxicology screen was negative.Computed tomography (CT) showed SAH with a large clot burden in the basal cistern and a left Sylvian fissure (Figure ).There was a trace intraventricular hemorrhage (Fisher Grade 4).A CT angiography of the head and neck was obtained and was negative for a vascular abnormality/aneurysm.Serum sodium was 143 mEq/L (normal 135-145 mEq/L).Six hours after admission, he became stuporous and required intubation.Repeat CT imaging showed increased SAH and new, left frontoparietal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; Figure ).His left pupil became dilated and nonreactive.He was resuscitated with hyperventilation, hyperosmolar therapy, including mannitol and hypertonic saline, as well as sedation.An external ventricular device (EVD) was placed, which revealed an elevated opening pressure.He was hemodynamically unstable with fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate.He was eventually stabilized with vasopressors and was taken to the operating room for emergent decompressive hemicraniectomy and clot evacuation.The distal middle cerebral arteries were subsequently clipped.The post-procedure cerebral angiography was negative for a vascular abnormality/aneurysm.CT head showed the right frontal EVD, clips in the left middle cerebral artery distribution, and decompressive hemicraniectomy (Figure ).\\\\nPost-evacuation, he developed refractory intracranial hypertension.He continued to receive osmolar therapy and eventually required prolonged neuromuscular blockade.His serum sodium increased to 156 mEq/L.Despite the elevated ICP, his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained.His oxygenation requirements continued to increase, requiring increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).Chest x-ray showed increasing bilateral pulmonary opacities.He developed a refractory fever that was controlled with an advanced cooling device (Arctic Sun, Bard Medical Division, Covington, GA, US).He received broad-spectrum antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia.TTE showed a normal ejection fraction without any areas of akinesis.On Day 8 of admission, transcranial Doppler (TCD) values for the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) was 220 cm/s, right MCA was 204 cm/s, right anterior cerebral artery (ACA) was 191 cm/s, left ACA was 89 cm/s, and basilar artery was 102 cm/s.He was treated with milrinone (0.1 mg/kg bolus over 10 minutes; then 0.5-0.75 mcg/kg/min infusion).The repeat TCD on the same day at 6.5 hours after the initial TCD showed a reduction in mean flow velocities in all vascular territories.Transcranial Doppler (TCD) waveforms from the left MCA, right ACA, and basilar artery, showing the pre-milrinone waveforms and the post-milrinone waveform (Figure ).\\\\nLeft MCA velocity decreased to 171 cm/s (22.27% reduction), right MCA to 156 cm/s (23.52% reduction), right ACA to 136 cm/s (28.79% reduction), left ACA to 84cm/s (5.61% reduction), and basilar artery to 63 cm/s (38.23% reduction) as cardiac function remained largely unaffected.Mean flow velocities in different blood vessels before and after milrinone therapy (Table ).\\\\nHis cardiac output, as monitored on FloTrac (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, US), remained unchanged at 7.8 L/min with a stroke volume variability (SVV) of 6%.Electrocardiography (ECG) was normal and cardiac troponin testing was negative.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed the known SAH and ICH with ischemia in the left MCA territory as a result of vessel clipping.', \"A 19-year-old man presented to our institute with right hand and foot dyskinesia.He had a significant family history of PKD.His uncle, grandfather, and grandfather's brother had involuntary movements triggered by voluntary movements.Proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) on chromosome 16, which is associated with movement disorders including PKD (PRRT2-PxMD), was confirmed in his uncle and grandfather through genetic testing (c.649delC/pArg217-Glufs).All of them underwent stereotactic ablative surgery (Vo thalamotomy).The patient's grandfather and grandfather's brother experienced complete remission of involuntary movement attacks after the surgery.His uncle experienced a significant reduction in the frequency of daily attacks without medication.The patient first experienced paroxysmal involuntary left hand and toe flexion with left forearm pronation triggered by sudden voluntary movements at the age of 14.The frequency of attacks was 20–30 per day.Carbamazepine (100 mg/day) was prescribed, which led to a significant reduction in the frequency of attacks.However, drowsiness was significant after the intake of carbamazepine and significantly interfered with his daily life, especially school life.He underwent right-sided Vo thalamotomy at the age of 15, which resulted in complete resolution of PKD attacks immediately after the surgery.The detailed clinical course of right-sided Vo thalamotomy has been reported previously ().Four months after the thalamotomy, the patient developed right elbow, hand, and toe flexion ().The frequency of attacks was 10–20 per day.The duration of the attacks ranged from 10 to 20 seconds.Carbamazepine (100 mg/day) was prescribed again, and the PKD attacks reduced to 5–10 times per day.However, the drowsiness induced by carbamazepine severely interfered with his daily and school lives.He underwent left-sided Vo thalamotomy at the age of 19.The target coordinate of the left Vo nucleus was set the same as in the previous surgery (15-mm lateral, 2-mm posterior, and 1-mm superior to the midpoint of the anterior commissure-posterior commissure).A total of six lesions were created on the left Vo nucleus in the same manner as in the previous surgery.Immediately after surgery, the PKD attacks resolved completely.However, mild dysarthria developed, which spontaneously resolved within three months.Left-sided PKD attacks never developed six years after the right Vo thalamotomy, and right-sided PKD attacks never developed two years after the left Vo thalamotomy without medication.The locations of the coagulated lesions were confirmed using Brainlab Elements.Bilateral lesions covered the Vo and ventral intermediate (Vim) nuclei ().The Vo nucleus is located just anterior to the Vim nucleus of the thalamus.We included both anterior and posterior coagulated lesions in order to cover the entire Vo nucleus.Based on our experience, insufficient lesions to cover the Vo nucleus are likely to develop symptomatic recurrence.The time course of PKD onset and intervention is shown in .The data for this study were retrospectively collected and analyzed.Considering the observational nature of the study, the ethics committee of our institution approved this study, and patient consent was waived.\", 'This 77-year-old male patient was transferred to our ICU 1 week after his COVID-19 diagnosis due to continuing respiratory decompensation requiring intubation.Following the acute phase, with intermittent proning, the patient continued to be hemodynamically unstable and was difficult to wean.Rehabilitation proved challenging under these conditions, and physical therapists had to reevaluate and adapt their interventions daily according to his condition.After 2 weeks, he was tracheotomized and started to improve very slowly.One week after tracheostomy, the patient was able to speak for the first time after a cuff-down trial and with the help of a speaking valve.But the patient spoke only a few words with us and it was often difficult to involve him in exercises.Two days later, he was able to communicate with his relatives via video telephony.This was a very emotional moment for everyone involved, but it improved his communication and he was able to express to his wife that he had no strength left to continue.However, through the family’s active participation in his early rehabilitation process, they were able to reinforce his confidence and motivation.He was discharged to a rehabilitation clinic severely weak (MRC-SS 40/60) and functionally impaired (CPAx 22/50), but continued to progress in slow steps.', \"We present the case of a 46 year-old-female, never smoker, with a history of ulcerative colitis who initially presented as an outpatient for the evaluation of persistent cough, wheezing, and chest tightness for 6 months.Her review of systems was otherwise negative and her only medication included mesalamine for ulcerative colitis.She had no history of environmental or occupational exposures and denied any allergies.She denied any personal or family history of lung disease.Her vital signs were within normal limits.This patient was evaluated by pulmonology and was diagnosed with cough variant asthma and was started on montelukast and albuterol as needed.A northeast allergy panel was unremarkable.She subsequently presented to the emergency room with an episode of wheezing and chest tightness and Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) revealed multiple lung nodules with mosaic attenuation.The nodules were seen bilaterally in clusters, with the largest measuring up to 1.8 cm in the right middle lobe.Multiple serologic markers were ordered to screen for autoimmune disease including ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel, Sjogren's antibodies, angiotensin converting enzyme, and rheumatoid factor.These were unremarkable other than a positive ANA with titer 1 : 640 homogenous pattern.Due to uncontrolled symptoms, her inhaler regime was escalated to Flovent twice daily with as needed albuterol.A repeat CT chest 3 months later indicated no change in diffuse mosaicism and multiple pulmonary nodules, similar in size, with the largest 1.8 cm in the right middle lobe (Figures –).She then underwent robotic-assisted navigational bronchoscopy with fine needle aspiration, brushing, and transbronchial biopsy of the right middle lobe nodule (Figures and).Pathology from the nodule was positive for groups of bland appearing small blue cells, consistent with low-grade neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid).Pathology was positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin, neuroendocrine markers, and low Ki-67 positivity, indicating low rate of proliferation (Figures –).Endobronchial ultrasound was also performed and Level 7 lymph node was negative for malignancy.The patient was presented at multidisciplinary chest tumor conference and it was recommended that she undergo PET CT scan and surgical resection of the biopsy-proven typical carcinoid tumor in the right middle lobe.\", 'A seven-year-old otherwise healthy female sustained bilateral elbow trauma after a fall with outstretched elbows and landing with force on the floor (kindergarten facility at the climbing frame).\\\\nThe neurovascular status of both upper extremities was intact upon the arrival of the patient to the Trauma Unit.Clinical examination revealed loss of any active movement in both elbow joints in every plane.The joint was locked in a relatively extended position with the forearm neutral to a slightly supinated position.The patient had no sign of swelling or hematoma.Clinical suspicion was guided to a complex elbow injury, possibly with the participation of various bony structures.\\\\nA gross estimation of the patient\\'s potential hyperlaxity was performed except for the elbow joints using the Beighton scale without significant clinical findings [].Neurovascular status of the upper limbs was thoroughly re-examined, but no sign of neural or vascular impairment or compromise was found.\\\\nPlain radiographs with standard projections (anteroposterior [AP] and lateral views) confirmed posterolateral elbow dislocation bilaterally with no signs of evident fractures.Identification of the bony structures was performed, and meticulous control and confirmation of the secondary ossification centers expected for the patient\\'s age was done to exclude any secondary damage (Figures -).\\\\nIn the emergency department, the upper limbs were immobilized in a provisional plaster with the elbows in a light hyperextension and neutral rotation of the forearms to reduce any movement and relieve the pain.The reduction was achieved under sedation in the operating theater and muscle relaxation with the patient in the beach chair position and with access to fluoroscopy during the whole procedure.The maneuver included gentle manipulation of the joints by slightly rotating, distracting and giving a flexion jerk to the joint.The audible and palpable \"click\" sign and the complete restoration of the arch of motion with the appropriate imaging confirmed the reduction as well as achievement of ligamentotaxis.Postoperatively, the patient retained both elbows in a functional position, stabilized with dorsal braces and collar and cuff to suspend the extremities (Figures -).\\\\nRemoval of any support took place in three weeks post-reduction, followed by mild kinesiotherapy and gradual return to moderate athletic activities.The patient achieved a full range of motion with no pain and excellent ligament stability.At the six-week follow-up, new radiographs were obtained, with normal findings.', 'The first case is of a 65-year-old Irish woman with a background of schizoaffective disorder, which had been stable in recent years, and a medical history of chronic renal failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, arterial hypertension, previous stroke with a right arm contracture, and aortic stenosis.For her schizoaffective disorder she was on a risperidone depot and escitalopram 20 mg once a day.She was admitted medically in December 2015 to the MMUH with a urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, and deranged international normalized ratio (INR).\\\\nThe Liaison Psychiatry service was consulted shortly after admission.The family gave a collateral history of low mood in our patient since her brother had become ill 2 months earlier and her dose of antidepressant had been increased a month earlier.On review, she was at her baseline mental state, engaging well in conversation and denying low mood, which was confirmed by the community mental health nurse, to whom the patient was well known.No changes were made to her management.\\\\nA week later the neurology service was asked to review the patient due to altered level of consciousness.On examination she presented with waxy flexibility, negativism, new onset increased tone of her left arm, posturing, and catalepsy.Her mobility had deteriorated, with selective speech, mute episodes, and poor oral intake noted by medical staff over the preceding day.The impression was that she was suffering from acute catatonia.An magnet resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain showed no acute changes.', ': A 56-year-old male treated for POAG with high IOP (30–48 mmHg) for a couple of years but after initial success of drops, he was referred to the clinic due to high pressures (over 40 mmHg).His mother was blind due to glaucoma (confirmed).He underwent trabeculectomy in both eyes when BCVA was 0.5–1.0, but 3 years later, vision deteriorated in both eyes (especially in right eye) despite IOP being maintained around the low teens.VF loss observed over 3 years seemed to be consistent with glaucoma and the island of central vision was lost last.The rapid decrease in central visual acuity in the presence of low and stable IOP was the reason for neuroimaging.He had an MR scan done that revealed an intracranial meningioma that was totally resected by bilateral craniotomy.The right eye is blind and the left eye has some useful VF with BCVA around 0.1 and has been stable for 2 years now.\\\\nSummary: this is true high tension primary glaucoma with a family history that progressed despite successful filtering surgeries.The true family history does not exclude intracranial malignancy, if the course of glaucoma is not typical (long-lasting deterioration after successful IOP drop and atypical pallor of the disc).It is difficult to determine the exact impact of high IOP vs.anterior visual pathway compression on vision loss in this patient.Additionally, disc pallor, a typical sign of compressive neuropathy, may be observed also in juvenile glaucomas or in cases with extremely high values of IOP.', 'A 35-year-old African American man was initially sent to our emergency room to evaluate a possible head trauma after a witnessed fall.He complained of frequent falls and leg weakness for 3–4 months.The weakness appeared to be progressive and persistent without episodic worsening.He had to use a cane to compensate but was still able to ambulate.His family members also endorsed cognitive defects over the past few months before admission.These impairments consisted mainly of apathy and withdrawal from social interactions; he used to be fully independent but now stayed at home most of the time.His medical history was only significant for alcohol abuse (three to four cans of beer and red wine daily for 2 years), and his family history was unremarkable.\\\\nPhysical examinations showed an age-appropriate, alert, and oriented man.He was able to engage in conversations with a paucity of speech and flat affect; he also made eye contact and followed all commands during our evaluations.\\\\nThere was bilateral weakness with spasticity in all lower extremity muscle groups.The deep tendon reflex was hypoactive with an upward response of the plantar reflex on the left side.He also had a wide-based unsteady gait and poor limb coordination.The remainder of the neurological examination and a general examination were unremarkable.\\\\nInitial brain computed tomography (CT) in our emergency room demonstrated a mass lesion occupying the left caudate and extending into his frontal lobe (Fig.).A brain MRI showed bilateral and symmetric hyperintense signals in the corpus callosum, periventricular white matter, and internal capsule (Fig.', 'A 60-year-old Caucasian male known to have a bicuspid aortic valve was admitted with a three-day history of cough, altered mental status, and left upper extremity weakness.He did not have any other significant medical or surgical history.At presentation, he was confused and afebrile.His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 8/15 (E2V2M4), blood pressure was 124/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 86% at room air.He was intubated for airway protection and respiratory support.Cardiac auscultation revealed 3/6 systolic murmur in the right second intercostal space, whereas lung auscultation revealed left lower zone crepitation.The abdominal examination was normal; he did not have any scars to suggest splenectomy.A complete neurologic assessment was not feasible, as the patient was intubated.\\\\nThe initial laboratory investigations showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.7 K/UL (reference range, 4.0 to 11.0 k/UL) with 90.9% neutrophils, and the platelet count was 34 k/UL (reference range 145-400 k/UL).His erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 71 (reference range, 0-22 mm/hr for men).Blood cultures collected before the initiation of antibiotics grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, which was sensitive to ceftriaxone and penicillin.His urine was positive for the Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen.\\\\nA chest radiograph and computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head done on admission demonstrated areas of consolidation over his left lower zone and the dilation of the lateral and third ventricles, respectively (Figure ).\\\\nTreatment for bacterial meningitis was initiated with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and dexamethasone empirically.Lumbar puncture was deferred due to the high risk of brain stem herniation secondary to hydrocephalus noted on head CT and high bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia (platelet count 34 k/UL).On day two of admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed scattered bilateral cerebral punctate infarcts suggestive of septic emboli along with hydrocephalus (Figure ).', 'A 45-year-old man (occupation: medical doctor) visited a university hospital with a chief complaint of fainting 1 day back.He had no history of medical problems and was not taking any medications.He had hiked 4 to 5 times a week for 2 years.Syncope occurred while hiking on a cold winter night (temperature: −8°C).He fainted while resting for a while in a standing position after hiking at a fast speed for an hour.The witness reported that he lost consciousness for about 1 minutes, and no head strike or seizure-like activity was observed.Upon awakening from syncope, the patient had no syncope recollection.After syncope, the patient did not have any illnesses or symptoms, such as headache, cognitive deficits, or somnolence.He had no prior episodes of syncope or fainting.\\\\nAt the time of examination (the day after the syncope), his blood pressure was 122/77 mm Hg, and his resting heart rate was 75 beats per minute.Electrocardiogram, 24 hours ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring, echocardiogram, tilt table test, and exercise tolerance test showed no abnormal findings.In addition, in conventional brain and chest computed tomography and brain MRI, no abnormalities were observed.', 'A 75-year-old male presented to our hospital with worsening mental status.Gait instability and expressive aphasia were noted on the physical examination.He was otherwise hemodynamically stable, with unremarkable laboratory studies and a negative urine drug screen.Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast showed a large right frontoparietal lesion crossing midline with surrounding vasogenic edema (Figure ).Further characterization with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 5.5-cm intra-axial mass within the deep white matter of the right frontal lobe, with gadolinium enhancement and prominent FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) signal concerning malignancy.\\\\nLater, the patient was started on dexamethasone, and a frontal stereotactic brain biopsy was performed.', 'A 27-year-old male patient was admitted to a high-complexity institution due to a five-day clinical picture consisting of additive, symmetrical polyarticular pain, located in the wrists, knees, and left shoulder without other associated symptoms.The joint pain was continuous, permanent, and of great intensity that caused limitation of movement, mainly in the hands.In the systems review, no urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms were documented before the onset of joint symptoms.As the only relevant antecedent, he referred mild respiratory infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction the month before hospitalization.The initial clinical examination confirmed the presence of bilateral carpal synovitis, left suprapatellar synovitis, and synovitis of the sternoclavicular joints (Figures , , ).\\\\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the different compromised anatomical compartments was performed, presenting as additional findings the presence of bursitis of the lateral collateral ligament of the left lower limb and a peritendinous inflammatory process of the triangular fibrocartilage in the right wrist.Mild lymphopenia associated with a marked elevation of acute-phase reactants was documented in laboratory studies.Differential diagnoses of infectious etiology were sought, including a positive fourth-generation HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a subsequent CD4 count of 98 cells/mm3 and a viral load of 459,000 copies/mL.Treatment with prednisolone at a dose of 1 mg/kg and sulfasalazine (1 g per day) was initiated and no significant improvement in joint symptoms was noted despite sequential changes from disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate and leflunomide.Subsequently, the patient achieved a complete joint response when antiretroviral therapy (abacavir, dolutegravir/lamivudine) was initiated, thereby achieving a response to therapy resulting in gradual reduction of glucocorticoid doses and tapering to maintenance therapy solely with sulfasalazine.The description of the most representative laboratory studies upon admission and during hospitalization is shown in Table .', \"A 48-year-old male with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis presented with shortness of breath for three days.The patient was transferred from an outside facility where he was found to be hypoxic, saturating 79% on room air, chest X-ray showing infiltrates, and a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.The patient had received two doses of the COVID vaccine, with the second dose in March 2021.Upon arrival to the general medical ward, the patient's vital signs were BP 132/79, HR 84 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 100% on 2-4 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and afebrile.Laboratory assessment is in Table .The patient was quickly weaned to room air, with SpO2 of 94-98%; hence, only supportive care was provided for COVID-19.On Day 1, the patient was found to have a right foot wound infection and was started on intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.On Day 2, the patient was found to be hypoxic, put on 5 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, and started on dexamethasone and remdesivir.Because of end-stage renal disease, the patient did not qualify for baricitinib.On Day 4, the patient required 10 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, which he needed until Day 12, when we could start weaning down the supplemental oxygen over the next 3-4 days until Day 15 to room air.On Day 17, the patient was put back on 2 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula which quickly escalated to 15 L on a nonrebreather mask within 2-3 hours, requiring the patient to get transferred to the intensive care unit on Day 18.At this time, he was put on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) with 40 L per minute of supplemental oxygen.Chest X-ray showed extensive diffuse airspace infiltrates, which significantly worsened from one week prior (Figure ).He was dialyzed without improvement from a respiratory standpoint and then intubated on Day 19.Subsequently, the patient was restarted on dexamethasone and broad-spectrum antibiotics despite completing 14 days' worth previously.\", 'A 39-year-old man was hospitalized due to an increasingly reduced general health condition, after persistent fever and dry cough for 2 weeks.The patient initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen, had a rapid and shallow breathing pattern at rest and became severely breathless during minor physical activities.In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises.However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa.The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet.To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea.He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises.Over the next days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and he regained his self-confidence.Therapy was progressively shifted to walking and strength training and the patient rapidly advanced to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before his discharge home.', 'A 53-month-old Sudanese female presented with progressive bilateral breast enlargement and accelerated growth since the age of 9 months.Her family had sought medical advice several times in different primary health care facilities and were reassured.She had no vaginal bleeding and no pubic or axillary hair.\\\\nExamination showed a well-looking girl, vitally stable with normal blood pressure.Her weight was 17 kg (50th centile) and height 108 cm (90th centile) using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth chart.Mid-parental height was 175 cm and predicted adult height was 167 cm using the JM Tanner formula.No previous documented follow-up growth data were available.Her Tanner staging was A1, P1, and B3.She had reddish mucoid vagina.She had no clitoromegaly, acne, hirsutism, or palpable abdominal mass (Table ).\\\\nLeft wrist X-ray revealed a bone age of 8 years.\\\\nThe hormonal evaluation using fluorometric enzyme immunoassay showed basal luteinizing hormone of 3.1 mIU/L, which increased to 8.8 mIU/L 45 minutes post-gonadotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation.Elevated levels of estradiol E2 29,000 pg/ml (5–15 pg/ml), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 90 ng/mL (2.3 ng/mL), with normal early morning cortisol level 16 ng/mL (7–28 ng/mL).Due to financial difficulties, we did not measured the follicular-stimulating hormone level.\\\\nAbdominal ultrasound revealed a right-sided hypoechoic suprarenal mass, an ovarian volume of 1.8 cm3, uterine volume of 3 cm3, and endometrial thickness of 1.2 cm.The abdominal CT scan showed a 25 × 22 mm well-defined rounded focal lesion with a smooth outline, at the level of the right adrenal gland with homogeneous attenuation, HU-7 on a noncontrast scan, and no evidence of local tissue invasion (Fig.).The left adrenal gland and ovaries were normal.\\\\nBrain magnetic resonance imaging was done to exclude a central cause of precocious puberty and was normal.Complete hemogram, liver, and renal functions were normal.\\\\nA diagnosis of an estrogen-secreting right adrenocortical tumor was made, and we referred the patient to surgery.\\\\nDuring laparotomy a 3 cm diameter tumor in the right adrenal gland was completely excised.The histopathological examination showed well-circumscribed tumor forming nests with trabeculae and sheets of polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm.The tumor was not infiltrating the capsule, with no mitosis, atypia, or necrosis (Wieneke index score = 0).Findings suggestive of benign adrenal cortical adenoma.\\\\nThe postoperative evaluation revealed normal cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.Estradiol E2 40 pg/mL was consistent with secondary central precocious puberty, so the patient was started on monthly gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist, with a regular follow-up plan for the possibility of recurrence of adrenal adenoma.\\\\nSix months after the operation, the patient was well and compliant to monthly gonadotrophin agonist injections.She showed partial regression of her secondary sexual characters and a growth velocity of 5 cm/year.The abdominal CT scan was normal with no evidence of recurrence.', 'Case 4 was a male child aged 5 years and 9 months.He had visited the hospital with a chief complaint of cold water pain in the anterior mandible.There was no history of trauma and caries in the primary teeth and no other systemic history.The cause of hypomineralization in the permanent teeth was not determined.The brownish-white in color were observed on the labial side of his lower central incisors ().The patient also complained of pain from air blowing and cold water, and the VAS value was 3.Immediately after the treatment to suppress the hypersensitivity, his VAS was zero.After one month, VAS was reduced to 0.5 and VAS was zero after four treatments.Seven treatments improved the color of the hypomineralization ().Cloudiness areas improved from 6872 to 1903, and brown areas decreased significantly from 6595 to 1667 ().', 'A 77-year-old Caucasian man with metastatic chromophobe renal cell carcinoma under treatment with an anti-PD1 mAb was admitted to our hospital with a severe persistent occipital headache of sudden onset 12 hours before.The patient’s past medical history included hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obstructive chronic bronchitis.He was a former smoker and had no drinking history.He used to work in finance and had no relevant family or environmental history.\\\\nThe patient’s daily medications included antihypertensive medications, oral antidiabetics, omeprazole, and prednisone 25 mg daily.The headache spread to the front and both sides of the head and was associated with nausea and asthenia.It worsened with coughing and other valsalva maneuvers such as lying down.It did not get better with nonnarcotic pain killers, preventing the patient from falling asleep.However, the patient did not have diplopia, photophobia, phonophobia, or any other related symptoms.On admission, his blood pressure was 154/68 mmHg, his pulse was 101 beats/minute, his temperature was 36.7 °C, and his arterial blood oxygen saturation was 98%.The results of his physical and neurological examinations were otherwise unremarkable.\\\\nAt the time of admission, the patient had been on corticosteroid therapy (0.5 mg/kg/d) for 10 days for suspected immune-related hyperthyroidism.He had tachycardia and mild diarrhea, and the results of his thyroid function tests were compatible with subclinical hyperthyroidism with a suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 0.01 μIU/ml (0.4–4.5) with a raised free T4 of 2.17 ng/dl (0.7–1.9) and a free T3 of 4.66 pg/ml (2.27–5).The last dose of the anti-PD1 mAb, the 11th dose, had been administered 3 weeks before.\\\\nA cranial computed tomographic (CT) scan showed an enlarged pituitary gland (15 × 20 × 14 mm), compatible with macroadenoma, without calcifications (Fig.and ).Taking into account the patient’s medical history, the initial diagnosis of an immune-related hypophysitis was assumed, and therefore we increased the corticosteroid dose to 1 mg/kg/d.Subsequently, a contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a pituitary lesion with hemorrhagic areas enlarging the sella, compatible with pituitary apoplexy (Fig.', 'A 5-year-old boy with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of DMD was referred for further clinical evaluation because of ID, ASD, joint hyperlaxity, and morphogenetic anomalies.A history of epilepsy with tonic–clonic seizures, photosensitivity, and moderate elevation in serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels following physical exercise was reported in his mother.He was born from non-consanguineous parents after an uneventful dizygotic twin pregnancy.A cesarean section was performed at 35 weeks of gestation due to a twin pregnancy.His birth weight was 2080 g (50th centile), and his Apgar scores were 81 and 95.His parents reported initial concerns during the child’s first year of life.A lack of eye contact, visual tracking, and social interest were noted from early on, associated with delayed milestones.He reached head control at 3 months and could not roll over and sit up without support till the age of 14 months; he walked independently at 4 years of age.On EEG, focal spikes over the frontal region and the left temporal region and generalized spike-and-wave complexes during sleep were detected in the absence of overt epilepsy.A brain MRI showed normal results.', 'A 41-year-old Japanese woman (gravid: 0; para: 0; height: 154 cm; weight: 52.2 kg; body mass index: 22.0 kg/m2) visited our department due to severe vomiting.Although hyperglycemia and hypertension had been identified upon screening at her workplace, she neglected these findings.She underwent medical examination for the vomiting at a local clinic; however, because her condition did not improve, she was referred to our emergency medical center.She had a history of appendicitis at 20 years of age, and she had undergone bilateral ovarian cystectomy for OMA at 28 years of age.She did not have any additional relevant medical or family history.\\\\nHer physical examination findings were as follows: blood pressure, 208/94 mmHg; heart rate, 96 beats/min; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; temperature, 36.6°C; and arterial oxygen saturation, 98%.In addition, her blood examination findings were hemoglobin level: 6.3 g/dL; hematocrit: 20.1%; white blood cell count: 17.35 × 103/μL; neutrophil percentage: 91.5%; platelet count: 637 × 103/μL; C-reactive protein level: 14.04 mg/dL; albumin level: 1.8 g/dL; blood sugar level: 450 mg/dL; HbA1c (NGSP): 13.7%; and brain natriuretic peptide level: 922.8 pg/mL.Moreover, her tumor marker findings included cancer antigen (CA) 125 level of 636.0 U/mL and CA19-9 level of 610.0 U/mL.Furthermore, her blood gas analysis findings were pH, 7.490; pCO2, 34.0 mmHg; and pO2, 64.9 mmHg. Chest radiography indicated a cardiothoracic ratio of ≤ 50% and a small pleural effusion.T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) revealed high-intensity signals in two ovarian tumors (tumor size: right < left) and masses with a maximum diameter of 59 mm in the left ovary ().', 'A 61-year-old male was diagnosed with de novo metastatic melanoma in January 2020 after presenting with sudden onset left upper limb dyspraxia and confusion.Comorbidities included hemochromatosis and a distant history of meningococcal meningitis.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain demonstrated a large right parietal lesion.', \"A healthy 43-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of a pruritic rash affecting her legs and abdomen.On exam, the patient was noted to have erythematous, blanchable papules coalescing into small plaques on her abdomen and distal part of the legs.Biopsy of the rash revealed an unremarkable epidermis and superficial perivascular lymphocytes with abundant interstitial eosinophils consistent with DHR.Patch testing was performed, which was 2+ for nickel sulfate and 1+ for p-tert-butylphenol formaldehyde resin, but the rash was persistent even with allergen avoidance.After failing multiple topical regimens, including triamcinolone and clobetasol, as well as oral prednisone, the patient was initiated on mycophenolate mofetil therapy, with excellent control but poor gastrointestinal tolerance.Her rash subsequently recurred, so dupilumab was started at standard dosing, and 5 months after starting dupilumab the patient's rash and pruritus had resolved without any side effects.\", 'A 48-year-old female from Honduras presented to the clinic with chief complaints of breast tenderness and galactorrhea for the past two to three weeks.She had a past medical history of hypertension, latent tuberculosis (TB) and sciatica.Her last menstrual period was three weeks prior to her presentation.Physical examination showed non-tender, diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, which was unchanged over the past one year.On palpation, breast examination revealed bilateral tenderness and milky yellowish discharge.The visual field testing and rest of the general physical examination were within normal limits.She was taking hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and losartan 50 mg daily for hypertension and was on isoniazid (INH) and vitamin B6 for the treatment of latent tuberculosis.She denied the use of tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, illicit drugs, or over the counter medicines.Laboratory investigations are given below (Table ).\\\\nShe had negative urine pregnancy test.Her mammogram was normal, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain didn’t show any pituitary mass.', 'A 71 year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and acoustic neuroma was admitted for right retrosigmoid craniotomy and tumor resection.Her operation was uneventful, with no immediate post-surgical complications.She was discharged on dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 3 days, with tapering doses of steroids over the course of 1 week.Three weeks later, she presented to the hospital with persistent fever and chills, and had experienced occasional headaches for five days.On admission, her vitals were significant with a temperature of 38.5 °C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 158/83 mmHg. On examination, she was alert and oriented to person, place, and time.Her right posterior auricular incision site looked clean, with mild erythema but no discharge.Sutures were intact.Neurologic exam did not reveal any focal or meningeal signs.Laboratory studies were significant with a white blood cell count of 8.9 k/μL, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, and a platelet count of 313 k/μL.Urinalysis showed 33 white blood cells, positive leukocyte esterase, and negative nitrates.Urine culture grew more than 100,000 colonies of Klebsiella pneumoniae.She was started on cefepime 2 g intravenously every 12 h for presumptive urinary tract infection.Despite antibiotic coverage for 3 days, the patient continued to have fevers up to 38.7 °C.Given her recent surgical intervention, a computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered, which showed a subgaleal collection overlying the craniotomy site and hypodense areas in the right cerebellum that likely represented postoperative changes.A hypodense extra-axial collection was noted along the right cerebellum.Given the concern for postsurgical meningitis, cefepime was switched to meropenem 2 g every 8 h, and vancomycin 1 g every 12 h was added to her antibiotic regimen.The patient showed a rapid clinical deterioration, with the development of nuchal rigidity, altered mental status, and seizures in the next 24 h.She underwent a lumbar puncture, which evidenced an opening pressure of 30 cm H2O.Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 800 white blood cells/mm3 with 90% neutrophils, low glucose (31 mg/dL), and high protein (115 mg/dL).The smear for acid-fast bacilli in CSF was negative.CSF Cryptococcus antigen was also negative.The FilmArray® meningitis/encephalitis panel did not identify any organisms.Emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered, which showed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and moderately dilated ventricles.', 'A 37-year-old Caucasian male patient was referred to our Department from the National Organ Procurement and Transplant Network waiting list for KT.\\\\nThe recipient was an unmarried office worker with hypertension under pharmacological treatment, no previous abdominal surgery and ESRD due to ADPKD currently not requiring hemodialysis (preemptive).Pretransplant estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 13.7 mL/minute per 1.73 m2.Body mass index was 21.9 kg/m2.At physical examination, an asymptomatic bilateral flank mass was palpable.\\\\nAbdominal MRI scan confirmed the presence of multiple cysts of different diameter within significantly enlarged native kidneys, whose sagittal diameter was >25 cm bilaterally ().', 'A 14-year-old boy presented to the ED.He had a 24-h history of nausea, diarrhoea, lack of appetite, and abdominal pain, mostly in the right iliac fossa.SARS-CoV-2 was detected via the PCR of his NP swab.On presentation to the ED, pain and tenderness on the right side of the abdomen were noted by examination.Abdominal ultrasound (US) showed findings consistent with acute complicated appendicitis.Empiric IV antimicrobial treatment with cefotaxime and metronidazole was begun and he was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy.An abdominal fluid culture revealed E.coli.The patient was admitted to the hospital during the first 24 h from the onset of symptoms, but the intraoperative findings of peritonitis and broad intra-abdominal inflammation may indicate that acute COVID-19 infection can speed up the disease course of acute appendicitis.', 'Case 4: A 31-year-old man presented with progressive blurred vision for 3 weeks.On admission, brain MRI showed multiple cystic lesions in the suprasellar cistern (Figures ).', 'A 72-year-old Caucasian woman who had type 2 diabetes and hypertension presented with diplopia in February 2010.Her vital signs were abnormal.Her blood pressure was high (150/95 mmHg), and her pulse rate and temperature were 65/minute and 37.1 °C.A neurological examination showed preserved muscular and neurological function and no signs of paresthesia or hypoesthesia; a general examination showed no other abnormality.There was no significant family or psychosocial history.She was taking perindopril 10 mg/day, metformin 2000 mg/day, and nateglinide 360 mg/day.She was a housewife and lived with her husband in a small town.She never smoked tobacco and did not consume alcohol.A brain and sella MRI showed a 3 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm mass in the sellar and parasellar region.', 'A 35-year-old female was admitted to our hospital complaining of an intermittent headache for 5 years, menopause for more than 2 months, and blurred vision and lactation for more than 1 month.Five years prior, the patient began suffering from intermittent and gradually deteriorating occipital and frontal headaches.One month prior to admission, she had impaired vision and an absent right temporal view and simultaneous bilateral galactorrhea, without purulent or bloody secretions.Since the onset of symptoms, the patient experienced no nausea or vomiting, sleepiness, chills, hair loss, or fatigue.Computed tomography (CT) showed an irregular cystic solid mass in the suprasellar area.The size of the mass was 1.4*1 cm and could be markedly enhanced.The CT value of the solid part of the lesion on plain CT was 40 Hounsfield units (HU); in the enhancement, the value was 74 HU, and the cystic part showed no enhancement.The boundary of the lesion was less clear, the density was not uniform, and no obvious calcification was observed.The cavernous sinus was involved.There were no abnormalities in the ventricular system, sulcus, brain split and pool.Moreover, there was no shift in the midline structure, and no abnormalities were found in the skull structure.The sinuses exhibited no obvious abnormalities.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and pituitary showed an irregular cystic solid mass in the suprasellar area, involving in the pituitary stalk, and the boundary between the lesion and pituitary was unclear.', 'An 86-year-old woman with back pain was referred to our hospital.At the time of presentation, she had no fever and no pain at rest.Roentgenography findings were relatively normal with slight narrowing at L1/2 (Fig.).She had no known drug allergies.She was administered analgesics and was kept under observation.One month after her first visit to our hospital, her back pain worsened, and her temperature was 37.2 °C.No neurological abnormalities were noted in her lower limbs.Laboratory findings at that time were as follows: C-reactive protein, 11.5 mg/dL (reference, < 0.2 mg/dL); white blood cell count, 7970/mm3 (neutrophils, 87.7%; reference, 4000–8000/mm3); aspartate aminotransferase, 15 IU/L (reference, 13–33 IU/L); alanine aminotransferase, 13 IU/L (reference, 6–30 IU/L); alkaline phosphatase, 291 IU/L (reference, 115–359 IU/L); and creatinine, 1.5 mg/dL (0.4–0.7 mg/dL).Radiographs of the lumbar spine showed collapse of L1 and an absorbable change in the caudal side of L1 (Fig.).Lumbar MRI confirmed the presence of fluid at the L1/2 disc, edema and destruction of the spinal body of L1/2, and lumbar canal stenosis at the level of L1/2 on fat-saturated T2-weighted images (Fig.', \"A 64-year-old male presented to the emergency room with a 2-week history of a severe, persistent headache.The patient's pertinent past medical and surgical history included obesity and an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion five years prior.A CT scan of the head followed by an MRI of the brain and spine revealed extensive pneumocephalus and concerns for meningitis.\", 'We present a 9-year-old girl with newly diagnosed DM1, DKA, brain edema, multifocal vasogenic brain lesions and lower limb paresis.\\\\nThe patient was reported to have polyuria and polydipsia over the past week and a weight loss of 3 kg over the previous month.The patient was admitted to the district hospital in a serious clinical condition with severe dehydration.Initial intravenous fluid therapy included infusion of 15 mL/kg of 0.9% sodium chloride during the first 90 minutes.The total volume of fluids administered during the first 12 hours and consisting of 1250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCI) and 1000 mL of 5% dextrose with 0.9% NaCI (2:1 proportion, sodium concentration-51.34 mEq/L) was 65 mL/kg (patient’s weight-34.6 kg).Intravenous insulin therapy was introduced in an initial dose of 0.05 units/kg/hour in order to prevent a rapid decrease of glycaemia.After three hours, the patient’s medical state and neurological condition was reported to deteriorate.She experienced motor restlessness and agitation followed by upper limb spasms.At the end of the first day of treatment the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Children’s Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 points.Results of laboratory tests are shown in .\\\\nSix hours after admission to the ICU, her clinical state was deteriorating rapidly and the GCS score had decreased to 7 points.Computed tomography scan revealed brain edema and a 13-mm hypodense lesion in the left temporal region ().\\\\nThe patient was sedated and intubated.Insulin infusion was continued and intravenous fluid administration was diminished.Anti-edematous treatment was introduced (Mannitol 0.3 g/kg/dose, three times per day).The patient’s state showed a gradual improvement.After four days, she was extubated.Subsequently the patient was transferred to the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology.Despite improvement in her clinical condition, the patient was found to have developed symmetric lower limbs paresis.Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed numerous, diffuse lesions (, ).', 'We report the case of a 4-year-old male child, admitted to our clinic for generalized seizures, which persisted in spite of anticonvulsant therapy (Diazepam), with no previous acute symptoms.His personal history revealed ureterovesical junction obstruction, mild hydronephrosis, and an episode of generalized seizures approximately 2 months before the current admission for which chronic therapy with sodium valproate (Depakine) was recommended.We must mention that the brain MRI performed at that time was normal.', 'The participant in this study was a 24-year-old man who was in a motor vehicle accident that led to a severe TBI two years ago.According to the report of the spiral brain CT scan, the primary lesion was located in the left frontotemporal area due to contusion, and a few lacunar infarcts were seen in the left basal ganglia.Before the accident, he was an active member of a music band and was involved in bodybuilding activities.He was hospitalized for 48 days after the accident.Following discharge from the hospital, he received regular rehabilitation, including electrical stimulation of the wrist and knee extensors and ankle dorsiflexors, resistance training, and aerobic and endurance conditioning (e.g., walking on treadmill and stationary bike).At the time of the first visit to the research clinic, he could not independently walk or stand up from a chair and was using a wheeled walker for mobility and an ankle foot orthosis to prevent drop foot.\\\\nThe clinical examination was performed by an experienced physical therapist.The participant had right (RT) hemiplegia with full and strong grasping and gripping but without the ability to write.Other impairments were aphasia, bradykinesia, and dyscoordination of movements of RT upper (i.e., finger to nose) and lower (i.e., heel to shin) extremities.Also, deep tendon reflexes were increased with no spasticity in his muscles.He was dependent in some activities of daily living (ADL) (e.g., dressing, toilet use, and feeding).', 'A 23-year-old woman presented with progressive headache, nausea, and vomiting for 1 week.Right-side weakness, ptosis, and diplopia were also found.Due to acute onset conscious disturbance (Glasgow Coma Scale of E3VaM5) in the hospital, brain computed tomography was arranged and revealed an enhanced brain tumor with necrotic cystic change.This tumor was located at the left temporal lobe with upward extension to the left basal ganglion and periventricular region, causing perifocal edema and midline shift ().We performed emergent craniectomy for tumor removal in December 2006.\\\\nPathology revealed pleomorphic, hyperchromatic cells with glassy, astrocytic cytoplasm, as well as hypercellularity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis, consistent with the diagnosis of classic GBM ().\\\\nThe patient underwent radiotherapy 1 month later and followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide for 6 months.Her performance status improved to a Karnofsky Grade of 70, and her clinical condition was stable thereafter.However, follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in June 2014 revealed a new enhanced nodular lesion, approximately 1.1 cm in diameter, at the left temporal base.', \"Twin B of a spontaneous dichorionic and diamniotic twin pregnancy of a 30-year-old multigravida was found to have symmetrical intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) at 25-week gestation (estimated fetal weight (EFW) <3rd percentile, intertwin weight discordance 28%), with abnormal Dopplers indicating increased placental resistance and cranial sparing with cephalization of blood flow.Also noted were mild right lateral cerebral ventriculomegaly, small stomach, and enlarged gallbladder.Aneuploidy screening results were low-risk, with cell-free DNA negative for trisomy 21, 18, and 13.Amniocentesis was declined.Maternal viral serology for cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and parvovirus was negative for recent infection.From 27 weeks onward, persistently absent end-diastolic flow of the umbilical artery was noted.Ventriculomegaly worsened to moderate range at 28 and 33 weeks, with bitemporal skull narrowing and strawberry-shaped skull appearance noted at 31 weeks (Figure ).Anhydramnios for Twin B was noted at 36-week gestation.As diagnosis of aneuploidy would affect postnatal management, bladder aspiration of Twin B was performed, but cell culture was without growth.At 38 weeks, the EFW for Twin B was 1559 g, with twin discordance of 48%.\\\\nThe patient was born at 38 weeks and 3 days gestation, via scheduled repeat cesarean delivery.Apgar scores were 5, 7, and 8 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes of life, respectively.He was small for gestational age (SGA) with birthweight 1133 g (Z-score: −5.49), birth length 39.4 cm (Z-score: −4.43), and head circumference 29.5 cm (Z-score: −3.23).Physical examination was significant for small facies with underdeveloped chin, relative macrocephaly, overlapping cranial sutures, mild crumpling of the ears, wide-spaced nipples, second and fifth fingers of the right hand overlapping the third and fourth fingers, and a small sacral hemangioma (Figure ).The patient developed hypoglycemia and hypophosphatemia, likely secondary to his IUGR/SGA status, which responded to modifications in intravenous fluids.He tolerated full enteral feeds by the second week of life, but due to poor oromotor skills, he was fully nasogastric tube-dependent.Patient developed self-resolving leukopenia.Thrombocytopenia, reaching a nadir on day of life (DOL) 2, responded to 1 platelet transfusion.Mild self-resolving anemia was noted with a high reticulocyte count.Second anemia nadir at fourth week of life was treated with epoetin alfa, with normalization of erythrocyte indices.From DOL 5 onward, patient had a prolonged need for respiratory support, attributed to chronic microaspirations, with a waxing-and-waning degree of respiratory distress, which was subsequently attributed to a hiatal hernia.Gastrointestinal contrast study showed approximately half the stomach within the thoracic cavity, along with an incidental finding of inguinal hernia.\\\\nDuring the patient's hospital course, extensive workup was completed as part of evaluation for the chromosome 19p deletion (see Section ).Initial head ultrasound showed a small hyperechogenic focus inferior to the third ventricle.Noncontrast brain MRI performed on DOL 23 showed normal findings.\", \"A 56-year-old female was diagnosed with primary biliary cirrhosis after presenting with pruritus and fatigue.Prior to this diagnosis, she worked as a business executive functioning at a high cognitive baseline.Jaundice and refractory ascites developed in the month prior to admission.Cognitive decline evolving over one month mandated her to take leave from work.She was referred to a tertiary centre specializing with hepatobiliary expertise.Her past medical history included arterial hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux, as well as cervicogenic headaches.She did not have psychiatric, legal, or relevant family history.Her baseline included diuretics, lactulose 10 ml TID, sodium benzoate 3g OD, metronidazole 250 mg BID, calcium carbonate 500 mg BID, and ursodiol 500 mg BID.Risperidone 1 mg OD and quetiapine 50 mg HS were prescribed at the time of referral but introduced after the neuropsychiatric presentation.No correlation could be established with her behavioural change and the pharmacotherapy after a meticulous review.\\\\nA general work-up was completed at the time of admission including albumin 34 g/L (N= 37-48 g/L), ammonia 20 mcg/dl (N= 15-45 mcg/dl), GGT 331 UI/L (N= 7-55 UI/L), ALT 74 U/L (N=9-30 U/L), AST 74 U/L (N=13-39 U/L), alkaline phosphatase 565 UI/L (N=36-110 UI/L), and INR 1.1. Psychiatry and neurology consultants reached the same conclusion: the patient's neuropsychiatric symptoms were atypical for hepatic encephalopathy [].She presented with personality alteration, psychomotor agitation, elevated mood, incongruous affect, ideoaffective discordance, and tangential, noninformative, and logorrheic speech as well as slightly decreased judgement.However, her orientation and insight were surprisingly intact.She scored 17/30 on the MOCA signifying a global cortical impairment.Disorganization and perseveration, along with auditory and somesthetic hallucinations, improved with neuroleptics.To provide an example, when this patient was informed of an upcoming neurology assessment, she completed her “homework” consisting of drawings and symbols.The neurological examination was unremarkable, mentioning absence of ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, areflexia, gait instability, or primitive reflexes.The possibility of a diffuse cortical cognitive alteration with repercussion on expression, speech, memory, and personality was considered.Latent schizophrenia was clearly excluded, which would have been a contraindication to liver transplantation.However, a manic episode due to an organic disease was investigated.\\\\nOver the following weeks, she remained significantly disorganized, despite the fact that PRN doses of olanzapine and haloperidol managed her agitation.Lithium and regular doses of olanzapine were introduced, without success.An extensive work-up was performed, confirming Child-Pugh class C liver cirrhosis through biopsy.A brain MRI featured bilateral basal ganglia hyperintensities ().\", 'A 63-year-old male presented on November 16, 2018, with complaints of persistent left epistaxis and a history of swelling in the left orbit and maxillary sinus for 3 months.Examination revealed multiple enlarged, indurated, and painless lymph nodes in the cervical and left submandibular areas, the largest of which was 4 mm × 3 mm.Blood tests at diagnosis showed anemia (Hb 122 g/L) and thrombocytopenia (90 × 109/L).Syphilis and HIV screenings were negative.Initial enhancement MRI scanning on November 27, 2018, revealed heterogeneous enhancement shadow filling in the left maxillary sinus along with adjacent bone absorption ().\\\\nThe patient underwent a subsequent biopsy by nasal endoscopy on November 29, 2018.', 'A 40-yr-old female patient was admitted to of Razi Hospital of Qaemshahr City in north of Iran in Nov 2015 with complaint of headache, blurring of vision, dysarthria and acute left-side hemiplegia and right-sided ptosis.Three weeks ago, she had gone to another hospital that after checking she was diagnosed with brain abscess.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with intravenous contrast was performed and showed a ring enhancement lesion in the right basal ganglia ().', 'An 8-year-old Caucasian girl was referred to our clinic for joint hyperlaxity, skin hyperextensibility and delayed wound healing.She was the second child of non-consanguineous parents, born preterm (29 weeks + 6 days) with an urgent Cesarean section due to maternal pre-eclampsia and placental abruption.Birth weight was low but appropriate for gestational age (930 g; 11th centile), and prematurity requested prompt admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.Twelve hours after birth, she experienced small bowel perforation due to meconium ileus, which required resection surgery and subsequent ileostomy without local complications.In the subsequent weeks, bilateral retinal detachment likely due to the retinopathy of prematurity was also diagnosed and promptly treated with laser photocoagulation and subsequent vitrectomy at 2 months of age.Additionally, she was diagnosed with bilateral cataract presumably secondary to prematurity.For this complication, she underwent surgery by the age of 18 months and 3 years to the left and right eye, respectively.The ophthalmologic prognosis was complicated by high-grade myopia and visual deficit.According to the last evaluation, she had a visual acuity of 3/10 in the left eye and a partial blindness in the right one (she only perceives lights), treated with daily topic ocular β-blockers.At the age of 7, she had a right traumatic femoral bone fracture after a minor trauma (a fall from a chair), requiring surgical treatment.\\\\nOn examination, the girl was found to be overweight (weight 75–90th centile; BMI 75th centile—CDC charts [], with generalized joint hypermobility (Beighton score: 9/9) (a), skin hyperextensibility, multiple atrophic and post-surgical dystrophic scars (b), multiple ecchymoses in her lower limbs, absence of lingual frenulum, mild right-convex thoracic scoliosis, bilateral genu valgum-recurvatum, cubitus valgus with elbows hyperextensibility and bilateral pes planus.She had no strength deficit, with global hypotonia but normal muscular trophism and deep tendon reflexes.However, she had a global hypotonia.Intellectual abilities were normal.She was able to walk, with the help of a crutch.On both legs, soft, velvety skin and subcutaneous tissues had been long misdiagnosed as a mild lymphedema.Parents also reported easy bruising for their daughter.None of her family members presented with similar signs or symptoms.Chest, spine and limb radiography confirmed the orthopedic abnormalities.Global respiratory function with spirometry, abdominal and supra-aortic trunk ultrasounds and video-electroencephalography all resulted normal.A comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation evidenced a mild mitral valve insufficiency without clinical relevance.No other vascular or lymphatic anomalies were detected.Multidisciplinary follow up, including pediatric, oculistic, psychiatric and cardiovascular evaluations, has been continued for 5 years.She reports no pain.She attends school with good cognitive and social skills and weekly swimming sessions.Support insoles were prescribed without a clear clinical improvement.', 'A 21-year-old male patient came to the hospital with complaints of fever, vomiting, pain in the abdomen, headache, and myalgia for three days.The patient was apparently alright three days ago when he started complaining of fever that was sudden in onset, intermittent, without diurnal variation, and not associated with chills or rigors.The fever was temporarily relived with antipyretics.He also had generalized weakness and joint pain associated with fever.\\\\nThe patient also complained of pain in the abdomen for three days.The pain was diffuse, present in the epigastrium and umbilical region, and aggravated after consumption of food.It was associated with nausea and vomiting.The patient had around four to five episodes of vomiting after food every day.Vomitus contained food particles.There was no hematemesis.The patient was nonalcoholic.\\\\nOn examination, his pulse rate was 88 beats per minute, blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg in the right arm in the supine position, and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.On abdominal examination, there was tenderness in the umbilical area.Heart sounds were normal, no murmur was heard, normal breath sounds were heard, and there was no focal neurological deficit.\\\\nOn investigation, the patient tested positive for nonstructural antigen 1 for dengue fever.Platelets on admission were 53000/mm3, which gradually decreased until the fifth day after admission and then progressively increased (Table ).The patient’s serum amylase and lipase were found to be raised.\\\\nUltrasonography of the abdomen showed a bulky pancreas without ascites.Following this, contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen was done, which revealed bulging of the uncinate process of the pancreas and peripancreatic fluid collection along with minimal ascites (Figure ).These features were suggestive of acute pancreatitis with a score of 2/10 (mild) as per the revised Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis [].\\\\nThe patient was kept nil by mouth and was treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics (ceftriaxone and doxycycline), antipyretics, opioids, and proton pump inhibitors.During the course of the hospital stay, the patient improved gradually along with an increase in platelet count.The patient did not require any platelet transfusion.Along with the improvement in hematological parameters, there was a decrease in amylase and lipase levels.He was discharged in stable condition eight days after admission in stable condition and is presently doing well on follow-up.', 'A 5-year-old male initially came to the attention of the immunology service at 2 years of age with a history of recurrent sinopulmonary infections and a family history of XLP1 (nonsense mutation c.191G>A in the SH2D1A gene).Of note, his uncle with XLP1 had a history of EBV-related central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.SAP expression was found to be absent in NK and CD8 cells, confirming the diagnosis of XLP1.NKT cells were undetectable.Profound hypogammaglobulinemia was also noted.He was monitored and maintained on monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions with only minor breakthrough sinopulmonary infections.Adherence to IVIG was suboptimal due to social reasons.The family deferred stem cell transplantation.At the age of 5 years, he presented with acute behavioral changes, manifesting as uncontrolled aggression, requiring inpatient psychiatric treatment.Basic labs including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were normal.Specifically, no cytopenias, no transaminitis, and normal inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP) and platelet count were noted.MRI of the brain showed multiple small nonenhancing foci on T2 FLAIR sequence, mostly in the frontal lobes and scattered throughout the subcortical white matter ().', 'On October 2016, a 66-year-old woman, never smoker, underwent upper left lung lobectomy and regional lymph adenectomy, for a pulmonary mass discovered on radiological examination for shoulder pain present for a long time.\\\\nThe gross examination of the surgical specimens showed an intraparenchymal, subpleural, whitish mass, measuring 8.5 cm in greatest dimension.Histologically, a well-circumscribed neoplasia composed of two different morphological components, which were separated in some areas and intermingled in others, was documented.The first component represented about 70% of the tumor burden and consisted of an organoid proliferation of polygonal, shaped uniform tumor cells with nuclei with finely granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli, consistent with carcinoid.Four mitosis/2 mm2 and diffuse, punctate necrosis were identified.The second component, representing about 30% of the tumor burden, showed a glandular architecture corresponding to acinar pattern of PA.Neoplastic infiltration of parietal pleura was documented (PL3).Immunoreactivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, and pan-cytokeratins (AE1-3 clone) was observed in carcinoid component, while glandular component was positive only for TTF-1 and cytokeratins; cytokeratin 7 was selectively expressed in the adenocarcinomatous component ().Metastatis constituted by both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine component was found in four out of six hilar lymph nodes, showing the same immunoreactivity in different neoplastic areas such as primitive lesion ().Immunoreactivity for ALK and ROS1 resulted negative in both component, in primitive tumor and in lymph nodal metastasis.TPS for PD-L1 was <1% in both component, in primitive tumor and in lymph nodal metastasis.A final diagnosis of “combined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid” was made with stage pT3 (PL3) pN2 sec UICC 2017.Each neoplastic component in both primitive and metastatic lesions was individually microdissected from unstained FFPE slides for DNA and RNA extraction.Targeted NGS analysis on Ion Torrent NGS platform was performed using the Ocav3 panel.\\\\nAmong the 161 investigated genes, both common and private genes mutations were identified in each investigated entity of primary and metastatic sites ().No shared point mutations, CNVs, or gene fusions were identified in both adenocarcinoma and carcinoid components from any sites (S1/S2 and mL1/mL2).By contrast, one somatic mutation in the PTEN gene (p.Thr319Ter) was detected specifically in the adenocarcinoma components of both primary and metastatic sites (S2 and mL2), whereas the carcinoid component of both sites shared one somatic mutation in the NF1 gene (p.Arg1325Thr).Primary carcinoid S1 showed one private somatic mutation in the CDK12 gene (p.Arg44Leu), whereas the adenocarcinoma component of metastatic site showed a private mutation in the NOTCH1 gene (p.Pro498Arg).\\\\nOn December 2016, she progressed due to the onset of osteoblastic bone lesions detected by TAC with a negative octreoscan performed on January 2017.In February 2017, cisplatin plus pemetrexed regimen started for six cycles, reporting a partial response after four cycles.In November 2017, due to a massive bone metastasis with bone marrow infiltration, the patient died.', 'A 46-year-old male was referred to our clinic due to a long history of persistent atrial fibrillation.He had arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus under good pharmacological control.He also had microcythemia due to a thalassemic trait.The atrial fibrillation was discovered seven years earlier with an electrocardiogram performed during a routine medical examination.The patient was asymptomatic for palpitations, irregular heartbeat, or other cardiological symptoms.An echocardiogram was performed without showing any pathological feature and oral anticoagulation with Dabigatran (CHA2DS2-VASC score 2) was started.After four weeks of therapy, electrical cardioversion was performed with effectiveness in restoring sinus rhythm.An antiarrhythmic therapy with Flecainide 100 mg twice daily was also initiated.The patient did not undergo further medical checks during the following five years, when, during a cardiological visit, the recurrence of the arrhythmia was discovered.The patient mentioned reduction in daily normal activity due to asthenia.An echocardiography exam showed a left atrial indexed volume of 36 mL/m2 and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 47%.AF ablation through PVI was proposed.At admission, the electrocardiogram showed AF.To perform an accurate anatomical reconstruction of the right and left atrium and a high-density voltage map, the multi-electrode mapping (MEM) catheter Pentaray™ (Biosense Webster, Johnson & Johnson Medical S.p.a., Irvine, CA, USA) was used.As in the previous case, we started by mapping the right atrium to define the inferior and superior vena cava, the His location, and the coronary sinus (A).Next, a decapolar catheter was inserted in the coronary sinus under 3D EAM guidance.Again, we mapped the FO looking for fragmented and low-voltage signals.However, this time, using the Pentaray™ catheter, we were able to achieve a higher signal resolution and to easily discriminate between a low-voltage and fragmented signal area, although the patient was in AF.Moreover, using the Pentaray™ catheter, we were able to acquire a detailed map in a shorter time (5 min with Pentaray™ catheter vs.10 min with Thermocool SmartTouch™ SF catheter in the previous case).Again, based on the 3D EAM and under ICE guidance, a single transseptal puncture was performed with the VIZIGO™ sheath and the transseptal needle, both visible on the 3D EAM system (B,C).The transseptal puncture procedure followed the same steps already described in the previous case (video of the puncture is available in the ).The Pentaray™ catheter was then advanced in the left atrium through the VIZIGO™ sheath and a detailed fast anatomical mapping of the chamber and the veins was obtained ().The VIZIGO™ steerable sheath was extremely useful to map all the left atrium structures and veins very quickly.Moreover, using ICE imaging and the CartoSound® module, we could identify important structures, such as the pulmonary veins (A) and the esophagus (B), and to co-register the ultrasound images with the fast anatomical map obtained with CARTO 3®.The Pentaray™ catheter was then replaced by the ThermoCool SmartTouch™ SF catheter to perform PVI following the CLOSE protocol [].Again, with the help of the VIZIGO™ steerable sheath, we performed ablations with good contact and stability, leading to a fast and effective PVI.As in the previous case, the entire procedure was performed without fluoroscopy and without complications (procedural time was 110 min, radiofrequency time was 19 min, and fluoroscopy time was 00:00 min:s).The patient was followed up 3 months after the procedure with an outpatient visit, echocardiogram, and electrocardiographic-Holter monitoring, which did not register any AF episode.The echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (65%) and the patient mentioned that there was not a reduction in normal daily activities.After 6 months follow-up, the patient is taking low dose of flecainide (50 mg twice per day), apixaban 5 mg twice per day and has not recurrences of AF.', 'A girl aged 12 years presented with fever, abdominal pain, and painful urination of one-day’s duration.The patient had tested positive for COVID-19 eight days before the onset of abdominal pain.SARS-CoV-2 was detected by the PCR of her NP swab.Per abdominal examination findings revealed superficial and deep tenderness in the right lower abdominal quadrant to palpation and localised tenderness to percussion.An abdominal US showed findings consistent with acute complicated appendicitis.IV antimicrobial treatment with cefotaxime and metronidazole was begun, and she was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy.An abdominal fluid culture revealed P.aeruginosa, Str.viridans, and Gemella morbillorum.', 'The mother, 34-years old, primigravida (G0P0), underwent all recommended tests.The first-trimester morphology scan revealed normal crown-rump length, visible nasal bone, and normal nuchal translucency value.Moreover, the double marker for chromosomal aneuploidies (13, 18, and 21) indicated a low-level risk.The TORCH IgM and IgG screening showed no acute or recent infection (negative IgM), and the IgG titer was high.The woman had not been previously exposed to harmful factors that would have justified placing the pregnancy in the high-risk category.The second-trimester morphology scan performed at 22 weeks confirmed the normal development of a female fetus.\\\\nHowever, at 33 weeks of pregnancy, the first abnormal sign was noted.The amniotic fluid quantity started to increase, leading to the diagnosis of polyhydramnios.Another visible alteration was the shape and position of the lower fetal limbs, indicating minor clubfoot and altered fetal biophysical profile.By the time the pregnancy reached 36 weeks, the biophysical variables were severely modified.The fetal heart rate monitored using the non-stress test was worrying.There were significant decelerations, abnormal fetal movement, and poor muscular tonus.Additionally, the quantity of amniotic fluid continued to rise.Cumulatively, these observations led to the decision to deliver the baby prematurely via emergency C-section, 36 weeks into the pregnancy.\\\\nThe C-section was uneventful, and the mother made a fast recovery, but the female newborn weighing 2200 g received an APGAR score of 3.Unfortunately, when thoroughly examined by our team, it was noticeable that the fetus’s movement, breathing, and swallowing capacity were impaired, and she was unable to sustain spontaneous breathing.The newborn was constantly and fully dependent on assisted mechanical ventilation.Her condition continued to deteriorate despite all the efforts.Unfortunately, at two months of age, the baby succumbed to respiratory failure and multiple associated complications.\\\\nBased on the clinical signs and paraclinical tests, we were able to establish the following diagnostics: generalized congenital muscular atony, right diaphragmatic hernia, cerebral atrophy, neonatal anemia, bilateral varus equinus, neonatal hypocalcemia, prematurity and low birth weight, ostium secundum atrial heart defect, and tricuspid valve dysplasia.\\\\nThoracic X-rays show reduced ribcage expansion of the right hemithorax, suggestive of right diaphragmatic hernia.The transfontanelar ultrasound and head CT showed moderate cerebral atrophy, mostly in the frontal lobe.The generalized and severe muscular hypotonia was investigated using a muscular biopsy that showed no significant alterations.Both tests for aminoacidopathies and spinal muscular atrophy were negative.Serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were high but with a tendency to normalize.The karyotype showed a normal profile 46XX.\\\\nGiven the multitude of heterogenic clinical symptoms, we suspected a genetic syndrome yet to be diagnosed, so we proceeded to perform an Array Comparative Genome Hybridization (aCGH) with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP).aCGH+SNP was conducted on a blade with 4 ∗ 180,000 (180 K) samples (110.112 CGH samples, 59.647 SNP samples, 3000 replicated samples and 8121 control samples) covering the entire human genome with a spatial resolution of ~25.3 kb DNA (G4890A, design ID: 029830, UCSC hg19, Agilent).The scans were interpreted with the CytoGenomics Agilent software, using standard interpretation parameters with a SureScan Microarray Scanner.The resulting profile was abnormal: there were three areas associated with loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 1 (q25.1–q25.3) of 6115 kb, 5 (p15.2–p15.1) of 2589 kb and 8 (q11.21–q11.23) of 4830 kb, a duplication of 1104 kb on chromosome 10 in the position q11.22, and duplication of 1193 kb on chromosome 16 in the position p11.2p11.1.\\\\nConsidering this abnormal genetic profile, the parental couple received genetic counseling.Furthermore, we continued to test both partners through Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) by Illumina.\\\\nThe results confirmed the following abnormal genetic profile; TTN (NM_001267550.1, sequencing): heterozygous variant on Chr2(GRCh37):g.179479653G>C—TTN variant c.48681C>G p.(Tyr16227*)—exon 260, heterozygous variant on Chr2(GRCh37):g.179396832_179396833del—TTN variant c.104509_104510del p.(Leu34837Glufs*12)—exon 358 (TTN: NM_001267550.1—reference sequence).The TTN variant c.48681C>G p.(Tyr16227*) creates a premature stop codon.Sanger sequencing also confirmed this variant and was classified as likely pathogenic (class 2).The TTN variant c.104509_104510del p.(Leu34837Glufs*12) creates a shift in the reading frame starting at codon 34837.The new reading frame ends in a stop codon 11 positions downstream.This variant has been confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and it is also classified as likely pathogenic (class 2) ().\\\\nIn light of the clinical outcomes, based on the previous unfortunate experience, the couple agreed to receive genetic counseling.The couple was advised to pursue in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-M).Considering the mother’s age and weight, her Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) serum level and antral follicle count, we used a short-antagonist ovarian stimulation (OS) protocol with 200 UI of FSH (follitropin beta) concomitantly with 150 UI of combined FSH and LH (menotropin).Ten days later, seven oocytes were retrieved through transvaginal, sonographically controlled follicle puncture.Five of them were injected through intracytoplasmic intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI), resulting in two blastocysts.The embryonic biopsy was performed on day 6 of the blastocyst stage for these two embryos ().\\\\nThe amplification of the entire genome was performed using the SurePlex DNA Amplification System by Illumina Inc.2018, California US.Using the BlueFuse Multi Analysis Software (Illumina Inc.2018, San Diego, CA, USA), all 24 chromosomes were detected euploid for embryos.The identification of the mutation TTN gene on exon 358 (father’s mutation) and exon 260 (mother’s mutation) was performed only for euploid embryos using Sanger sequencing with specific primers on ABI 3500.PCR products for both embryos were purified and sequenced in both senses with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit by Thermo Fisher Scientific.Specific primers were manually designed according to both mutations and tested afterwards using blood samples from the parents.Both embryos tested by PGT-A were euploid.One of them was a carrier of the mother’s mutation c.48681C>G p.(Tyr16227), exon 260, and the other was a wild type (WT) for both mutations ().\\\\nWe performed a frozen-thawed embryo transfer in the following cycle, transferring the WT euploid embryo after endometrial preparation with exogenous estrogen.The result was positive, and we confirmed the ongoing viable pregnancy via ultrasound 14 days after.\\\\nThroughout the pregnancy, we performed the non-invasive double marker test (low-risk result) and fetal DNA analysis using maternal blood (low-risk result) and an invasive amniocentesis at 17 weeks of gestation, indicating a normal genetic profile.To test whether or not the second fetus presents a genetic abnormality, we extracted the DNA directly from the amniotic fluid.Targeted sequencing was performed on both DNA strands of the relevant TTN region.The reference sequence is TTN: NM_001267550.2. To exclude maternal cell contamination (MCC), we analyzed 15 STR autosomal markers plus amelogenin using the PowerPlex 16HS multiplex kit (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA).Moreover, all the non-invasive ultrasound scans showed a normal growth rate and organ development.The evolution of the pregnancy was uneventful, and at 38 weeks, we carried out the C-section delivery of a healthy female baby of 2990 g, receiving an APGAR score of 9.', \"A 34-year-old mother of two children presented in 29th week of her third pregnancy with hypertension.She is a diagnosed patient with diabetes mellitus for 6 years.However her previous two pregnancies, which were two and seven years back, were not complicated with hypertension or diabetes mellitus.She was not detected to have hypertension until the early third trimester of this pregnancy despite frequent clinic visits where blood pressure measurement was a routine practice.She described episodic palpitation, headache, and sweating suggestive of hyperadrenergic spells associated with episodes of high blood pressure.At the same time, her blood pressure and blood sugar levels were fluctuating and difficult to control with her usual medications.On examination, she was an averagely built lady with no features suggestive of syndromic associations (such as mucosal neuromas, café au lait spots, axillary or inguinal freckling, and iris hamartomas).Cardiovascular system examination was unremarkable except for a blood pressure of 170/110 mmHg. Ophthalmoscopic evaluation did not revealed retinal angiomas.Her 24 hour urinary vanillin mandelic acid level was 22.2mg/24hrs (1-13.6 mg/24hrs), 24 hour urinary metanephrine was 188.2µ g/24hrs (<350 µ g/24hrs), and 24 hour urinary normetanephrine was 653µ g/24hrs (<600 µ g/24hrs).\\\\nUltrasound scan of the abdomen done at 29 weeks of POA by consultant radiologist showed a hyperechoic hypervascular well-defined right supra renal mass which is in contact with but not invading the right kidney.The ultrasonic appearance was suggestive of a pheochromocytoma and there were no lesions suggestive of metastasis elsewhere in the abdomen.Patients' management decisions were taken by a multidisciplinary team meeting held with the participation of the surgeon, radiologist, obstetrician, neonatologist, anesthetist, and the endocrinologist where they decided to proceed with an interval adrenalectomy to avoid the detrimental complications of handling hypervascular tumor which was closer to the liver at the time of the caesarean delivery.Her blood pressure control was achieved by an alfa adrenergic blocker (initially prazosin and later phenoxybenzamine) followed by a beta adrenergic blocker which was started after adequate alfa blockade.Blood sugar control was optimized with basal bolus regimen of insulin.Her delivery was done at the 36 weeks of gestation by an elective LSCS under close supervision for adrenergic crisis.Peripartum period was uneventful and there was no adrenal crisis.She gave birth to a healthy baby of a birth weight of 3.6kg.CECT abdomen with adrenal protocol was planned after one month postpartum.She was discharged on the 12th postpartum day after close maternal and neonatal surveillance.The patient and her family were well educated regarding the disease and the need for close monitoring of blood pressure.Her blood pressure was monitored weekly at the hospital.She was well compliant on twice a day premixed insulin and self-monitoring of blood sugar.\\\\n20 days after the delivery she presented with a sudden onset severe headache with vomiting.Blood pressure was normal and fundi did not revealed papilloedema.Noncontrast CT brain () showed early hydrocephalus with a suspicion of posterior fossa space occupying lesion.\\\\nShe was transferred to neurosurgical unit and contrast MRI brain () showed two multiloculated cystic lesions one in relation to the fourth ventricle and the vermis and the other lesion in the periphery of the left cerebellar hemisphere which were suspicious of cerebellar hemangioblastomas.\", 'A 73-year-old male presented to the emergency department with persistent hiccups over the past five days.The patient is a known diabetic and hypertensive for 15 years and has rate-controlled atrial fibrillation, managed with beta-blockers and warfarin.Two weeks ago, he suffered a subacute ischemic infarct of the right medial occipital lobe, which was confirmed on a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain.The patient had both a preserved gag and swallow reflex.The family reported one bout of post-prandial emesis while upright five days earlier, after which the hiccups began eight hours later.The patient had no other symptoms, and the family denies him experiencing fever, chills, dyspnea, cough, malaise, and confusion.\\\\nOn clinical examination, there were decreased breath sounds and crackles noted in the basal segments of the right lower lobe.The patient had a low-grade fever (temperature 37.8 C) whilst other vital signs were stable (blood pressure 134/92mmHg, heart rate 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturations 97%).Chest radiograph confirmed the presence of bilateral lower lobe pulmonary infiltrates (Figure ).Blood investigations revealed a leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (Table ).Blood cultures were negative and arterial blood gases were normal.Additionally, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was negative.A tentative diagnosis of persistent hiccups secondary to aspiration pneumonia was made.The patient was immediately started on an intravenous antibiotic regime consisting of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1g at 12-hour intervals and metronidazole 400mg dosed at eight-hour intervals.Additionally, the patient was placed on a low-dose chlorpromazine infusion (25mg chlorpromazine diluted in 1000ml 0.9% saline infused over four hours), and his blood pressure was closely monitored.\\\\nThe patient experienced a near-complete resolution of his hiccups within 36 hours of treatment and a complete resolution prior to discharge four days later.Laboratory investigations were repeated prior to discharge and a decrease was noted in both CRP and leukocytes (Table ).The patient was transitioned to a 10-day course of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and metronidazole.At outpatient follow-up 14 days later, the patient is well and had no recurrence of the hiccups.', 'A 31-year-old woman with a VNS implantation three years prior to her MEG recording presented for further evaluation.Since age 5, the patient had focal seizures that began with a “funny feeling,” flushing, and head turning to the right.Some seizures terminated at this point, while at other times her seizures progressed to impair awareness and/or evolved into a bilateral convulsive seizure.Treatment with several antiseizure medicines failed to improve the woman’s seizure frequency.An MRI did not demonstrate any structural brain abnormalities.', 'We report the case of a 2 months old female, presented for consultation due to the presence of a lump on her left thigh, with progressive and constant growth after birth.The lesion was first described on the prenatal ultrasound at 30 weeks of gestation as a pre-femoral soft tissue mass of 20/7 mm ().The patient was delivered by cesarean section due to fetal distress but was otherwise normal at birth.Development was normal, and there was no relevant family history.On clinical examination, there was a 25/10 mm nodule on the antero-intern side of the left thigh that was firm, mobile and within the deep layers.The overlying skin was normal.There were no other lesions elsewhere on the patient’s body.\\\\nThe initial X-ray and ultrasound (US) showed a pre-femoral soft tissue mass that measured approximately 30/13 mm, with nonhomogeneous structure, hypoechoic areas, calcifications, and weak Doppler signal, being located anteriorly to the vascular elements of the thigh (A).Abdominal ultrasound was normal.\\\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass of 19.33/15.19/34 mm, with a nonspecific vascular involvement (B).', ': An 82-year-old male was treated for NTG elsewhere but referred to our clinic for consultation and for left ptosis surgery.His BCVA were 1.0 and 1.0, right and left eye, respectively, and he had normal IOP (14 mmHg).On ophthalmoscopy, both discs look glaucomatous, but the left disc more advanced.Only the left eye exhibited VF changes typical for glaucoma that corresponded ideally with a retinal nerve fiber layer thickness defect in OCT examinations.NTG was stable but unilateral.An MR scan was performed that revealed picture of 4 × 4 mm pituitary microadenoma contacting the chiasm.In three years’ observation, visual field and the tumor size remain stable.\\\\nSummary: this is the case of unilateral stable glaucoma with coexisting pituitary adenoma.It is unclear if the combination of glaucoma and microadenoma is pure coincidence, or if the microadenoma is responsible for the neuropathy.', 'A 50-year-old man presents with acute onset of double vision.His eye vitals are otherwise normal.He has a past medical history significant for diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.He denies headache or eye pain.The ophthalmologist on call was unable to be reached.The tele-neurologist recommended a non-contrast CT/CTA, which was reported to be normal.No additional testing was done, and the patient was discharged and told to follow-up with an ophthalmologist.One week later, the patient is found down and arrives at the ED in an ambulance.The patient never regains consciousness and passes away from a ruptured aneurysm.\\\\nManaging double vision can prove equally as challenging as managing visual loss without an accurate ophthalmic examination.In a university-based ED setting, patients are typically seen in person by the ophthalmology residents on call, who are in turn supervised by a neuro-ophthalmologist.The neuro-ophthalmologist is then able to confirm a clinical diagnosis of a cranial nerve palsy or any other etiology of double vision.Depending on the diagnosis, the appropriate radiologic imaging protocol is followed and then interpreted by a neuro-radiologist.In the community-based ED setting, this stepwise evaluation and approach is not readily available.In this setting, a very helpful starting point is to take comprehensive external photos of the patient in the nine positions of gaze (i.e., straight ahead, up, down (with eyelids held up), left, right etc.).A list of the recommended diagnostic work up for common causes of double vision are presented in .', 'A 75-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency room with the chief complaint of left-sided facial weakness.He noticed the weakness while brushing his teeth, and also noted slurred speech.He denied eye pain, tearing or redness, hearing loss, difficulty with swallowing, and weakness or numbness in his extremities.He was able to understand and express his words without any difficulty.He denied any headache, gait problems, falls or recent illness, and prior history of stroke or seizures.Past medical history was positive for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and multiple myeloma (MM).He was on chemotherapy with ixazomib, acyclovir prophylaxis, and a daily aspirin.Vital signs were unremarkable.Physical examination was significant for lower facial muscle weakness with no difficulty in closing the left eye.His National Institutes of Health (NIH) stroke scale was two for facial weakness and dysarthria.\\\\nHis blood work was remarkable for mild anemia and normal serum calcium.Coagulation workup was unremarkable.A non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) of the head showed acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right parietal region with global cerebral atrophy (Figure -), (repeat CT of the brain four weeks later showed the same hyperdensity; see Figure ).\\\\nHowever, CT angiogram of the head and neck was unremarkable.On day two, he was unable to close his left eye with Bell’s phenomenon.The differential diagnosis considered were lower motor neuron (LMN) facial palsy from multiple myeloma or diabetes mellitus or focal seizure from acute right parietal intracerebral hemorrhage.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed hyperintensity in T1-weighted sequence (Figure ), no significant post-contrast enhancement (Figure ), blooming artifact in the susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) (Figure ), and hyperintensity in T2-weighted fluid attenuation and inversion recovery (FLAIR) test (Figure ) consistent with possible right parietal hemorrhage or calcification.\\\\nVaricella zoster antibody test was negative.', 'A 30-year-old male with no past medical history moved from Puerto Rico three weeks prior to admission.He was found unresponsive at home with foamy secretions around his mouth.Paramedics found him apneic and pulseless.Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated and he had the return of spontaneous circulation after prolonged CPR.He was admitted to ICU and started on therapeutic hypothermia.His urine toxicology revealed cocaine, benzodiazepines and cannabinoids and most likely etiology for his cardiac arrest was thought to be due to overdose.Antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam) and vasopressors were initiated for septic shock along with mechanical ventilation and intubation for respiratory failure.His significant laboratory studies were as below in Table .\\\\nHe remained unresponsive on discontinuation of propofol but he showed muscle twitching.Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed encephalopathy without seizure activity (Figure ).\\\\nOn day three he had repeated episodes of twitching, decerebrate posturing, eyes rolling for which propofol was restarted.Repeat EEG showed similar results to prior EEG.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed diffuse injury and restricted diffusion involving both basal ganglia, bilateral frontal and occipital cortices (Figures , ).\\\\nHe continued to have repeated episodes of decerebrate posturing, rhythmic jaw movements, sweating, fever, and tachycardia.', 'A 78-year-old man presented with a 5-year history of extreme pruritus.No significant dermatitis was observed aside from faint pink patches on the upper chest and lower back with mild lichenification.Patch testing was performed and revealed 1+ positivity to potassium dichromate, but no culprit allergens were identified.A biopsy taken from the right part of the chest revealed mild acanthosis and minimal spongiosis with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate containing rare eosinophils in the presence of a negative direct immunofluorescence test, consistent with a DHR.The patient failed multiple therapies including topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, doxepin, narrow-band UV-B light, doxepin, gabapentin, butorphanol, and aprepitant.Azathioprine was poorly tolerated due to fatigue.The patient was then started on dupilumab with dramatic improvement in his pruritus and a 50%-60% reduction of the rash within the first 2 months with no associated side effects.His condition remains stable on this medication.\\\\nAdditional clinical information is summarized in .', \"A 60-year-old Japanese male patient without any past medical history presented with dyspnea for 5 days in June 2019 (before the COVID-19 outbreak).He had no history of cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, or sick contacts.He had a frequent cough, tachypnea (40 breaths per minute), low-grade fever (37.2°C), and hypoxemia (PaO2, 50.2 mm Hg on room air).He did not have wheezes or lung crackles and abnormal heart sounds on auscultation.Edema, skin rash, muscle weakness, myalgia, and arthralgia were absent.Blood tests revealed leukocytosis (10,300 cells/μl with 76% neutrophils, 2.0% eosinophils, and 14.0% lymphocytes) with high C-reactive protein levels (5.27 mg/dl).He had normal liver and renal function tests (aspartate aminotransferase 25 IU/L, normal <38 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase 30 IU/L, normal <40 IU/L; blood urea nitrogen 13.6 mg/dl, normal <20 mg/dl; and creatinine 1.04 mg/dl, normal <1.10 mg/dl) and no elevation of creatinine kinase (155 IU/L, normal <170 IU/L).Autoimmune screening did not identify any abnormalities, including anticyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) antibodies, anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies, anti-Scl-70 antibodies, anti-Sjögren's syndrome-related antigen A (SSA/Ro52) antibodies, anti-aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetase (ARS) antibodies, anti-Jo-1 antibodies, and anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibodies.Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse ground-glass opacification and consolidation in bilateral lung fields (Figure ).On the day of admission, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly and he received noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NPPV).The diagnosis of rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease with autoimmune disorders, such as severe inflammatory myopathy-related interstitial lung disease, could not be ruled out.Based on the diagnosis of ARDS of unknown etiology (PaO2/FiO2 235 with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O), high-dose (1000 mg/day) intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone therapy was initiated.Empiric antibiotics (IV piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin) were also given, although blood culture and urinary pneumococcal and Legionella antigen tests were negative.After 3 days of steroid pulse therapy, the patient improved dramatically and was weaned from NPPV and, thereafter, from oxygen support.The dose of IV methylprednisolone was reduced to half every 3 days and later it was switched to oral prednisolone (60 mg/day), which was also gradually reduced.Chest CT scan taken on the 13th day of admission revealed almost complete disappearance of abnormal shadows from the lung field (Figure ).He was discharged without dyspnea on the 26th day of admission.The steroid was tapered down gradually and discontinued 7 months after discharge.Although the patient had been asymptomatic for a while, he had a relapse of dyspnea in 10 months later after the first onset of ARDS.Upon the second admission, he had hypoxemia (PaO2 64 mm Hg) on O2 5L/min via face mask and started receiving NPPV therapy.Chest CT scan showed a mixture of diffuse ground-glass opacification and consolidation similar to roentgenological patterns observed previously (Figure ).The findings of physical examination and blood tests were not significantly different from the previous admission except that he had grasping pain in both thighs, proximal muscle weakness in extremities, and elevation of serum creatinine kinase (1741 IU/L).He had no skin eruptions, such as nail-bed telangiectasia, heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules, Raynaud's phenomenon, and hyperkeratotic lesions on his fingers (mechanic's hands).The short-tau inversion recovery sequence (STIR) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed inflammatory changes in both hamstring muscles (Figure ).\", 'A 90-year-old male was found in his home slumped to his right side and unable to be awakened.Paramedics calculated an 8/15 Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, which remained the same on admission.On presentation to the hospital, the patient had left facial droop, bilateral pinpoint pupils, and right-sided weakness.The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 26, suggesting a severe stroke.All other observations on admission were non-revealing, including vital signs, biochemical tests, and systems review.\\\\nThe patient’s neurological medical history included two previous transient ischemic attacks and suspected dementia.Other past medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, adult polycystic kidney disease, hypercholesterolemia, and aortic valve sclerosis.He was an ex-smoker of unknown pack-years and prior to admission was living independently.\\\\nInitial head CT performed only showed chronic small vessel disease with periventricular leukoaraiosis, consistent with his age.Thrombolysis was initiated with an intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator, however, the patient’s GCS declined to 6/15 approximately 40 minutes after the start of thrombolysis.A repeat head CT was performed, again showing no acute findings.To prevent further deterioration, a decision to monitor the patient’s condition conservatively was made.\\\\nOver the next few days, the patient remained very somnolent.When the patient was able to awaken, he was only capable of responding to simple commands.Speech and language therapists noted that fatigue was limiting conversations, with the patient speaking with imprecise articulation and at a low volume.Occupational therapists concurred that the patient was poorly engaged during sessions, while physiotherapists classified this patient as having limited rehabilitation potential.\\\\nStroke was finally confirmed upon a third head CT several days after admission, which showed bilateral thalamic infarcts.Other findings included hyperdensity at the basilar tip and left posterior cerebral artery, likely due to wall calcification of vessels.An MRI revealed bilateral hyperintensities in the thalami, consistent with acute bilateral thalamic stroke, with small left parietal cortical infarction (Figure ).\\\\nImaging also confirmed the arterial location of the infarction, a single branch of the pre-communicating (P1) segment of the left posterior cerebral artery known as the artery of Percheron (AOP).', 'A 74-year-old male with a history of two transient ischemic attacks was brought into our facility for altered mental status after being found unconscious by a relative.His social history was significant for 55 pack-years of smoking.Due to his mentation on arrival, no further history was obtained.Vital signs were normal on admission.Physical examination on admission showed non-responsiveness to sternal rub, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and thick white plaques around the corners of his mouth.Examination of the extremities showed 1+ bilateral lower leg edema, and pulmonary examination revealed right-sided wheezes and rales.\\\\nOn admission, the patient had an elevated blood glucose of 662 mg/dL (normal: 70-110 mg/dL), an anion gap of 15, ß-hydroxybutyrate of 1.86 mmol/L (normal: 0.02-0.27 mmol/L), point-of-care (POC) lactate of 3.3 mmol/L (normal: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L), serum potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, urine volume of 850 mL, and no ketones on urinalysis.The arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.48, HCO3 of 24.6, and PCO2 of 33 meq/L.The slightly elevated anion gap on admission is likely multifactorial.It could have been caused by the increase in the negative charge for albumin and enhanced production of lactate seen in metabolic alkalosis [].Conversely, it is also possible that scant ketones, which are produced in a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, as seen by mildly elevated β-hydroxybutyrate and the absence of ketones in the urine, could have contributed to the elevated anion gap [].\\\\nAdditionally, the patient had hypernatremia (sodium of 185 mEq/L corrected for hyperglycemia), acute kidney injury (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] of 49 mg/dL, creatinine [Cr] of 1.55 mg/dL, from a previous baseline Cr of 1.01 mg/dL), and hemoconcentration (hemoglobin [Hb] 17.1 g/dL, hematocrit [Hct] 51.6%).Chest X-ray indicated a potential right lower lung zone infiltrate.Computed tomography (CT) of the chest indicated right lower lobe mass or consolidation, with multiple mediastinal and hilar masses as well as enlarged left axillary nodes compatible with lymphadenopathy, suggestive of malignancy and metastatic disease (Figures , ).CT of the abdomen showed heterogeneous liver attenuation but could not differentiate between nonocclusive disease and metastatic disease.Adrenal nodules and kidney nodular densities were also present (Figure ).CT of the brain showed a suprasellar mass measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm (Figure ).The patient was started on half normal saline and insulin, and the acute kidney injury significantly improved on day 3; however, no significant improvement in sodium level was noticed after correction for elevated glucose levels (Figure and Table ).\\\\nAdditional investigations for the refractory hypernatremia showed a urine osmolarity of 699 (normal: 50-1,400), serum osmolarity of 360 (normal: 280-301), urine sodium of 10 mEq/L (normal: 20 mEq/L), serum AM cortisol of 61.3 ug/dL (normal AM: 6.2-19.4 ug/dL), 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test cortisol of 6.06 ug/dL (normal: <1.8ug/dL) and ACTH of 228 pg/mL (normal: 7.2-63.3 pg/mL) (Table ).MRI of the brain revealed a 1.1 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm enhancing lesion of the optic chiasm without evidence of mass effect (Figure ) and small lymph nodes in deep portions of the bilateral parotid glands that were potential metastasis.', \"A 42-year-old healthy man, with a previous episode of food impaction and increased number of eosinophils in esophageal biopsies taken during an index upper endoscopy 6 weeks earlier, underwent outpatient control gastroscopy after receiving proton pump inhibitor treatment.The upper endoscopy was performed under conscious sedation with midazolam, with a standard video endoscope and the air pressure setting on the video processor at “medium.” Biopsies from distal, middle, and proximal esophagus were taken according to standard protocol.At the end of the 7-minute-long procedure, just after biopsies from proximal esophagus was taken, the patient's heart rate decreased to 46, the oxygen saturation decreased to 90%, and he developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures.The endoscope was rapidly withdrawn, and the oxygen saturation and heart rate normalized spontaneously.However, the patient was unresponsive despite reversal with flumazenil.While hemodynamically and respiratory stable, he remained unresponsive, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS 3), with pupils midsize, equal, and reactive to light, and a negative Babinski sign.\\\\nAn immediate computed tomography (CT) scan 30 minutes postinitial symptoms revealed massive air embolism in the right hemisphere.(Figure A).The radiologists first suspected infarctions, which was later modified.A complementing CT angiography (CT-AI) was performed 70 minutes after the initial CT scan to rule out differential diagnoses, and the delay was due to recurrent seizure and intubation.The most striking finding was complete resolution of air in the vessels.(Figure B).\\\\nSimultaneously with the CT-AI, a CT of the thorax was performed showing air around the whole length of the esophagus and small amounts of free air in the mediastinum behind the left atrium.(Figure ).\\\\nThe neurologist on call contacted the hyperbaric unit, and the patient was transported to the hyperbaric unit, arriving three hours after initial symptoms.HBOT with United States Navy (USN) (Table 6 (Figure A)) was commenced immediately.The patient remained completely unresponsive during the initial 20 minutes of compression despite a confirmed gas embolism, and to maximize the therapeutic effect, the treatment table was extended to 8 hours and 5 minutes.(Figure B).After initial HBOT, the patient underwent a second CT scan, 12 hours after the initial CT, which to our surprise showed normalization, with only slight reduced attenuation in the right parietal area (Figure A).As the patient remained unconscious and there was a concern of much more damage to the brain than evident on the CT, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed.\", 'The first patient is a 53-year-old male with a long history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.He had some cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure that had been well controlled for 5 years on a therapy with ACE inhibitor.He did not suffer from other relevant comorbidities, except for sleep apnea syndrome on home nocturnal ventilatory support.He had his first episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation six years before and he started oral anticoagulation with dabigatran (CHA2DS2-VASC score 1) and antiarrhythmic therapy, initially with Flecainide and then with Amiodarone.Despite this, he had been admitted several times to the emergency room due to irregular heartbeat episodes and other symptoms, such as palpitations and shortness of breath.The arrhythmic recurrences often required electrical or pharmacological cardioversions to control the symptoms.The patient was then referred to our clinic because of the gradual worsening of his symptoms.The arrhythmic episodes lasted several hours, with spontaneous resolution, crippling him in his daily life.Considering his young age, the absence of cardiac structural alterations, and the inefficacy of the rhythm control strategy, AF ablation was proposed to the patient.At admission into the ward, the patient was overweight (body mass index was 38 kg/m2) and the electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, while the pre-procedure echocardiography revealed dilated left atrium (left atrial volume 43 mL/m2) and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle of 55%.\\\\nWe started the procedure by performing a bipolar map of the right atrium with a ThermoCool SmartTouch™ SF (Biosense Webster, Johnson & Johnson Medical S.p.a., Irvine, CA, USA) ablation catheter.First, we delineated the inferior and superior vena cava, and the coronary sinus, and we tagged in yellow the His potential (A).Next, we carefully reconstructed the interatrial septum and, finally, to precisely define the fossa ovalis (FO), we set the color range on the bipolar map to 0.25–0.75 mV and we tagged in light blue all the fragmented and low voltage signals, which are typical of the FO area [] (A).The FO location was further confirmed by the ICE and the CartoSound® module (Biosense Webster, Johnson & Johnson Medical S.p.a., Irvine, CA, USA).A 10F Soundstar™ Ultrasound catheter was advanced in the right atrium and pointed at the FO.Thanks to the CartoSound® module, it was possible to mark the contours of the FO location and to visualize them on the 3D EAM previously obtained (B).In addition to the FO, using ICE and the CartoSound® module, it was possible to assess and to reconstruct the structures of the left atrium (left atrial appendage, pulmonary veins, and esophagus).Next, a single transseptal puncture was performed using the bidirectional guiding sheath VIZIGO™ (8.5F) and a transseptal needle (standard Brockenbrough needle 98 cm from Abbott, St. Paul, MN, USA).Since the sheath is visible on the Carto 3® EAM system, it was possible to place it in the superior vena cava (3 to 4 cm above the cavoatrial junction) without any use of fluoroscopy.At this point, the guidewire was removed and the transseptal needle with the stylet was gently inserted and advanced through VIZIGO™, avoiding pushing the needle over the tip of the sheath.In this step, the needle and the sheath were held in the fingers between 4 and 6 o’clock.The needle and the sheath were pulled back caudally, visualizing the VIZIGO™ sheath with the 3D EAM system until it reached the level of the coronary sinus and the tip of the dilator inside the sheath placed in the FO.From this location, the VIZIGO™ sheath was pushed and placed on the FO under the guidance of the EAM system and confirmed by ICE imaging (C).When the sheath was in the right position, the transseptal needle was advanced to perform the puncture.Live tracking of the distal part of the needle on the 3D EAM system was possible thanks to an Alligator clip lead wires (FIAB Spa, Florence, Italy) connected to the distal portion of the needle (see ).Both the transseptal sheath and the needle should be advanced for 1–2 cm in the left atrium (LA).Then, holding the needle, the sheath was advanced over the needle.Finally, the needle and the dilator were kept steady, and the sheath was advanced over the dilator.The transseptal sheath was deaired and a 0.032 inch guidewire was advanced toward the left superior pulmonary vein under ICE guidance.\\\\nAfter a successful transseptal puncture, the ThermoCool SmartTouch™ SF catheter was advanced through the VIZIGO™ sheath into the left atrium to perform a fast anatomical mapping and PVI following the CLOSE protocol [].With the help of the VIZIGO™ steerable sheath, we performed ablations with good contact and stability, leading to fast and effective PVI.There were no complications during the entire procedure.The procedure time was 100 min, radiofrequency time was 20 min, and, finally, the fluoroscopy time was 00:00 min:s.The patient was followed up 3 months after the procedure with an outpatient visit and electrocardiographic-Holter monitoring, which did not register any AF episode.After a 9 months follow-up, the patient presents no more symptoms, is not taking any antiarrhythmic drugs, and does not have recurrences of AF.He is taking apixaban 5 mg twice a day and ACE inhibitor drug for blood pressure control.', 'The second patient we are reporting is a 28-year-old right-handed woman, who came to our attention for a severe depressive episode.Her psychopathological onset is placed 10 years ago; she developed her first depressive episode with comorbid panic attacks.From that moment the patient has alternated phases of depression with sporadic episodes of elation, thus a sign of hypomanic episodes, which led clinicians to a diagnosis of BD-II.Her depressive phases used to have a seasonal pattern, with autumn or winter worsening.When she came to our attention (November 2020), the current episode had been lasting for 3 months, according to her seasonal pattern.She reported low consumption of alcohol in social circumstances and sporadic use of cannabis in her adolescence.\\\\nRegarding her ED, binging behaviors were reported to happen from the first diagnosis of depression, with various degrees of intensity and severity, and appeared to be more intense in depressive phases.Binge eating episodes during depressive phases used to be daily.No compensatory behaviors were ever observed.Notably, her first BED diagnosis was given in our center during her last depressive episode, as she had always been trying to hide her eating behaviors, even with physicians.Along with the current depression, she referred almost daily binge eating: after her dinner she used to go out and then buy and rapidly eat large amounts of high-fat food.This used to cause both physical and psychological distress.\\\\nIn her past pharmacological history, many pharmacological therapies had been prescribed (i.e., valproate, fluoxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine, and bupropione) and when she came to our attention her therapy was clomipramine (150 mg daily) and pregabalin (225 mg daily).Her depressive symptoms at baseline were severe according to both MADRS and HAMD ().', 'A 24-year-old healthy woman presented with difficulty breathing and dissatisfaction with her facial appearance.She had a history of childhood trauma resulting in nasal septum deviation and external nasal deformity.Four months after a successful and uneventful septorhinoplasty, she presented to the emergency department with blunt nasal trauma resulting in a septal hematoma, which was drained successfully; the patient was discharged with no adverse sequelae.\\\\nFour months later, the patient sustained nasal trauma again, this time accompanied by clear nasal discharge, raising suspicion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.The patient was discharged after managing the nasal injury, as the CT brain showed an intact cribriform plate with no evidence of a CSF leak.Ten days later, she presented at the emergency department with dizziness and an unstable gait.She also had complaints of paresthesia for the past two months, beginning in her right hand and progressing to the right shoulder, arm and leg, associated with some difficulty in the execution of movements in the first and second finger of the right hand.Her right leg was quite stiff with difficulty in walking.On close inquiry, she gave history of pain in the right eye and double vision many months back, which had resolved spontaneously.Examination showed a positive Romberg’s and Lhermitte’s sign, with right-sided sensory impairment.\\\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, cervical and thoracic spine demonstrated demyelinating lesions in the brain and cervical segment of the spinal cord (Figure ).', 'Male, 80 y/o, with a metabolic syndrome.He underwent thromboendarterectomy because of right internal carotid artery serrate stenosis.Due to bivasal critical coronary stenosis (anterior descending (DA) and left circumflex (LCx)) and severe degenerative aortic stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG: left internal mammary artery (LIMA-IVA)) and aortic bioprosthesis implantation (Intuity 25 mm) in 2019.Ten months after surgery, he started developing intermittent fever with serial hemocultures growing Enterococcus faecalis.TTE detected paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) with focal hyperechogenic thickening of the leaflets.Diagnosis of endocarditis was made, and antibiotic treatment was started (meropenem shifted to ampicillin and ceftriaxone according to the antibiogram).TEE showed a pulsatile perivalvular pseudoaneurysm in the mitroaortic intervalvular fibrosa ().MDCT was performed a few hours later, confirming the presence of a pseudoaneurysm with the maximum axial size of 15 × 10 × 30 mm communicating with LVOT through a 5 mm window, and also detected a periaortic abscess in the anterolateral side of the vessel with longitudinal extension of 4 cm, which was only poorly detected by TEE (a–c).', 'A 21-year-old female patient without any known adverse medical background presented with a 1 month history of headache, nausea, fatigue and blurred vision.Physical examination and computer tomographic (CT) scan showed pericardial inflammation and splenomegaly (2 cm).Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye revealed papillary edema, retinal hemorrhages (Roth’s spots) and arteriovenous nickings (for further details see Fig.and Table ).Initial laboratory evaluation of peripheral blood (PB) revealed a white blood cells (WBC) of 113.2 × 109/l (72% were blasts), red blood cells (RBC) count was 2.53 × 106/mm3, with a hemoglobin level of 9 g/dl and a platelet count (Plt) of 61 × 109/l.Prothrombine time was 15.1 s (normal value 10.0–13.0 s) while partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was 25.8 s (normal value 29 ± 3.5 s).Creatinine value showed 38.7 μmol/l (normal 45–120) and uric acid value 498.2 μmol/l (normal 150–450).Bone marrow (BM) aspiration revealed 70% of blasts (Fig.).\\\\nAt this point the first cytogenetic and immunophenotypic data were determined.Flow cytometric (FCM) analysis classified this case as AML-M1.The patient was given standard treatment for AML including (3 + 7) induction chemotherapy (Daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 for 3 days and Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 for 7 days).On day + 28 of treatment with (3 + 7) protocol, the patient had not responded as expected to the treatment, i.e. her PB revealed pancytopenia/cytopenia (WBC 0.4 × 109/l), anemia (hemoglobin level = Hgb: 9.5 g/dl); thrombocytopenia (Plt 12 × 109/l) and less than 7% blasts in BM aspiration.The patient was given re-induction chemotherapy (ICE protocol: Cytrabin 200 mg/day: day 1 ➔ day 7, Etobside 100 mg/day: day 1 ➔ day 5, and Idarubicin 20 mg/day: day 1 ➔ day 3) and she achieved complete remission on day 30 of ICE protocol treatment (WBC 7.4 × 109/l; Hgb 11.6 g/dl; Plt 183 × 109/l), with less than 4% blasts in BM aspiration.Still the patient suffered from blurred vision in the right eye (retinal detachment sensory serous) during ICE protocol treatment but her karyotype was normal.The patient was given consolidation I chemotherapy (High dose Ara-C = HIDAC: Cytarabine 3 g/m2/day; day 1 ➔ day 3; and Methoxantron 20 mg/day; day 1 ➔day 2).Afterwards the patient did not return to the hospital to continue the treatment for 6 weeks.Then she was referred to the hospital again for blurred vision in the right eye and a mass under the vascular arch with splint edema of optical nerve of the right eye was diagnosed, being the cause of her severe decrease in vision.While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test was negative, BM aspiration revealed 20–30% of blasts.In PB WBC was 5.6 × 109/l (98.5% of neutrophils), Hgb was 11.6 g/dl, Plt of 70 × 109/l indicated for thrombocytopenia while CT scan of brain was normal.Now she treated with consolidation II chemotherapy (HIDAC), 2 weeks later her PB had WBC 0.1 × 109/l, Hgb 8.4 g/dl and Plt still 20 × 109/l; the mass behind the retina of the right eye was still present.\\\\nAbout 2 months later the patient relapsed and the following values were found: in PB WBC was 7.5 × 109/l with 77.7% of neutrophils, Hgb 12 was g/dl and Plt was 178 × 109/l; BM aspiration revealed 15% of blasts.The MD’s suggested to apply now the Flag-Ida protocol; however, due to the political situation in her home country only available treatment at this point was treatment with Cytrabin 100 mg/day.Again 2 weeks later the patient suffered from blurred vision of the right eye due to serious central retinal detachment; her PB revealed a WBC of 60 × 109/l (70% of them were blasts), Hgb of 13.3 g/dl; thrombocytopenia with Plt of 13 × 109/l was present with a normal brain MRI.', 'A 33-year-old female with no prior medical comorbidities, who recently gave birth to a healthy girl child four months ago, was brought to the emergency department with sudden onset weakness of both upper and lower limbs that started four days prior and rapidly progressed to a state of quadriplegia.She was conscious and obeyed simple commands with eyes and mouth; however, she had severe dysarthria.She had bilateral facial palsy and bulbar palsy.She had flaccid, hyporeflexic, pure motor quadriplegia with limbs showing only a subtle withdrawal flicker to pain.MRI of the brain revealed hyperintensity in the central pons in diffusion-weighted images (Figure ), T2-weighted images (Figure ), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (Figure ) without abnormal contrast enhancement (Figure ), consistent with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) (Figure ).\\\\nThe biochemical analysis showed hypernatremia while the remaining electrolytes were normal.', 'A previously healthy 25-year-old man presented with multi-fragmentary fractures\\\\nof the lower third of right tibia and fibula as a consequence of a motorcycle\\\\naccident ().Upon hospital\\\\nadmission he was alert, coherent and had no motor deficits.His vital signs and\\\\nthe rest of a physical examination were normal.He was admitted to the hospital\\\\nfor surgical stabilization.Forty-eight hours after admission, he developed\\\\nconfusion and agitation followed by a rapid decline in his level of\\\\nconsciousness that progressed to coma with bilateral extensor posturing.His\\\\npupils were equal, slightly large and reactive.He was tachypneic (44/min),\\\\ntachycardic (137/min), febrile (39.3°C) and hypertensive (147/101mmHg).His\\\\npulse oximetry was 92% on room air.Petechial hemorrhages were noted in the\\\\nsclerae, conjunctivae, buccal mucosa and the upper third of the thorax.\\\\nResuscitation was initiated with fluids, supplemental oxygen, tracheal\\\\nintubation and mechanical ventilation under deep sedoanalgesia.A head computed\\\\ntomography (CT) scan revealed multiple and bilateral frontal subcortical\\\\nhypodense areas without a midline shift.No hemorrhage was evident, and the\\\\nbasal cisterns and sulci remained visible ().\\\\nA chest CT was normal except for small bilateral basal atelectasis with no\\\\nevidence of pulmonary embolism.Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal\\\\nventricles, normal valve function and an absence of patent foramen oval or signs\\\\nof pulmonary hypertension.An electroencephalogram revealed diffuse slowing\\\\nwithout epileptiform discharges.The laboratory parameters were normal except\\\\nfor elevations of the following inflammation markers: leukocytosis\\\\n17300/mm3 and C-reactive protein (CRP) 141mg/L.Thrombocytopenia\\\\n(110.000/mm3) was also noticed.A diagnosis of FES was reached.\\\\nSupportive therapy was provided, and methylprednisolone (10mg/kg/day) was\\\\nadministered for 3 days.Two days later, given his clinical stability, the\\\\nsedation and analgesia were withheld to assess his neurological status.After 10\\\\nminutes, bilateral and spontaneous extensor posturing was observed in\\\\ncombination with mechanical ventilation asynchrony, tachypnea (46/min), profuse\\\\nand generalized sweating, arterial hypertension (215/112mmHg) and tachycardia\\\\n(137/min).These manifestations were recurrent and led to the diagnosis of PSH.\\\\nConsequently, propranolol (120mg/d) and morphine (3mg) every 4 hours were added\\\\nto the therapeutic regimen.The sedoanalgesia was reinstituted.Two days later,\\\\na brain MRI revealed multiple small lesions in both cerebral hemispheres that\\\\nwere hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR, did not exhibit\\\\nenhancement after gadolinium injection and were located in the periventricular\\\\nwhite matter of both frontoparietal regions ().\\\\nThe episodes of PSH had durations that oscillated between 20 and 35 minutes,\\\\noccurred with a frequency of 3 to 4 times daily and were mainly associated with\\\\nstimuli such as the turning, bathing, aspiration of secretions and pain.', 'A 68-year-old female presented 4 days following the onset of nausea, headache and neck pain.Her symptoms were increasing in severity and associated with left-sided inco-ordination and subtle facial weakness.A CT scan was performed and demonstrated a 3-cm left extra-axial posterior fossa lesion abutting the tentorium suggestive of a meningioma and associated with significant cerebellar oedema but no hydrocephalus.As a result, an MRI of the brain was performed that demonstrated a lesion with marginal enhancement, causing adjacent significant oedema.', 'A 2.4-year-old girl was hospitalized on October, 2015 due to 3-day persistent fever and cough, without underlying disease.Reservoir mask of 10 l/min was utilized for ventilatory support.Due to pulmonary CT suggested inflammatory consolidation with atelectasis, the first FB was used for treatment and etiological diagnosis.After 2 days of cephalothin and azithromycin treatment, she still had fever and cough and developed hypoxemia.Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 45 mm Hg, PaO2 of 52 mm Hg, and oxygenation index of 247.Then, nasal high-flow oxygen of 10 l/min was adopted and methylprednisolone was applied for anti-inflammation.Physical examination revealed temperature 38.3°C, heart rate 135 beats/min, respiration 45 times/min, blood pressure 85/50 mm Hg, transcutaneous oxygen saturation 93% without oxygen administration, fatigue, flaring of nares, and decreased respiratory sound in the left lung.Cardiovascular, nervous system, extremities, ANA, and ENA examinations were normal.The routine blood tests indicated Hb 118 g/l, WBC 6.25 × 109/L, N 55.3%, L 37.6%, and CRP 26 mg/l.On day 4, pulmonary CT suggested inflammatory consolidation accompanied with left pleural effusion ().\\\\nFiberoptic bronchoscopy and pathological results revealed fibrinoid formation in the left upper lobe and lower lobe, indicating plastic bronchitis ().BAL fluid was negative in etiological, except for MP-DNA and Epstein Barr (EB)-DNA up to 1 × 108 copies/ml and 4.8 × 105 copies/ml, respectively.MP resistance mutation site 2063/2064 was also positive.No other etiological evidence was found in body fluid and secretions.Hypokalemia (K 3.28 mmol/l) and dysfunction of blood coagulation () occurred during disease.On 5th day, chest radiography showed increased patchy shadows in the left lung ().Therefore, the second PB was performed to relieve bronchial casts.After administration with methylprednisolone of 10 mg/kg/d and gamma globulin of 2 g/kg, body temperature returned to normal and anoxia was improved on the 6th day.The methylprednisolone was applied for 11 days.She was discharged on the 12th day and the titer of MP-IgM was increased by eight times on the 14th day ().In the follow-up, she still had cough on the 18th day.On the 48th day, the chest X-ray turned to normal ().', 'A 35-year-old man presented with the complaints of low back ache for 12 years, radiating to right leg for 4 months and numbness extending to lateral side of the sole of right foot.On examination, there was a 30% sensory loss in right S1 dermatome as compared with contralateral limb, with no bladder bowel involvement.Patient had no motor deficit.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine was suggestive of IM cystic lesion at L2-3 hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images.', 'A pregnant female, 34 years old, fourth gestation primiparity with current pregnancy estimated at 25 weeks of amenorrhea (WA) + 5 days, diabetic for 1 year, initially on oral antidiabetic drugs and then insulin therapy, hypertensive for 2 years on alpha methyldopa with a history of 3 miscarriages secondary to hypertensive peaks.\\\\nDuring the 4th pregnancy, the patient was hospitalized at 20 WA in the endocrinology department for an etiological assessment of a hypertensive crisis at 180/110 mmHg associated with headaches, palpitations and hot flashes, without proteinuria or edema.\\\\nIn front of these symptoms the diagnosis of a secretory neuroendocrine tumor is suspected, and a biological assessment including urinary and plasma catecholamines (metanephrine and normetanephrine) came back positive after eliminating other causes of secondary hypertension (nephropathy, renal artery stenosis or hyperaldosteronism), by renal evaluation, renal artery Doppler ultrasound and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system exploration.\\\\nUrinary dosages showed Metanephrines at 0.87 μmol/24 h (normal: 0.20–1), high Normetanephrine 24.14 μmol/24 h (normal: 0.4–2.10), While plasma dosages showed a Metanephrine level of 0.10 nmol/l (normal: < 0.33 nmol/l), a high level of Normetanephrine of 14.02 nmol (normal: <1.07 nmol/l).A thyroid workup was performed to rule out multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) returning normal: TSH 1.821 (normal: 0.340–5.330), anti-thyroperoxidase Ac < 0.8 IU/ml (normal <0.8).\\\\nAbdominal-pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing an abdominal latero-aortic mass measuring 36 * 33 mm, corresponding to paraganglioma without any other obvious location [].\\\\nFor evaluation of maternal and fetal impact of the tumor:\\\\nClinical examination including cardiovascular examination was normal.', 'An 11-year-old female with no previous medical history presented with floater symptoms in her right eye.She had no medical or ophthalmological history that may contribute to the condition, such as hypertension and thrombocytopenia, which can cause bleeding.The patient had no trauma or medication history.Her BCVA (best-corrected visual acuity) by the Snellen chart was 20/20 in both eyes, with intraocular pressure of 15 mmHg in her right eye and 16 mmHg in her left eye.Slit lamp examination revealed no specific findings in the anterior segment of both eyes and no relative afferent pupillary defect, but − 3.5 diopters of myopia was noted in both eyes.Fundus examination and optical coherence tomography showed tilted disc, intrapapillary hemorrhage, peripapillary subretinal hemorrhage, and mild vitreous hemorrhage in her right eye (Fig.), Fluorescein angiography showed blocked fluorescence due to peripapillary subretinal hemorrhage at the early phase, but no definite leakage or new vessels were noted at the late phase (Fig.).We recommended further evaluations, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the patient (with their guardian) chose to undergo only ophthalmological evaluation.', 'We herein present a case that was recently managed at our institution, the Department of Surgery of the San Camillo Forlanini Hospital of Rome, Italy.\\\\nA 53-year-old man with previous history of alcohol-related liver cirrhosis presents to our department for routine follow-up.His comorbidities include hypertension managed with oral antihypertensive drugs and diabetes mellitus type 2.He has no significant allergies and never underwent any surgical procedure.He brings an ultrasound, which shows a 4 cm heterogenous mass in segment 8.His alfafetoprotein level is elevated to 76 ng/mL.He has no symptoms and looks in good performance status.We scheduled him for a triphasic CT scan, which shows a lesion of 4.3 cm with brisk arterial contrast and venous washout.According to the LIRADS classification, this lesion could be considered a class 5 with diagnostic features of hepatocellular carcinoma.The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary tumor board including hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, hepatologists, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, and interventional radiologists.The plan was to submit the patient to curative intent treatments given his early presentation according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System (BCLC), namely surgical resection or liver transplantation; radiofrequency ablation was excluded given the tumor’s dimensions.Given the good performance status, the position of the lesion (which was right below the Glissonian capsule) and the liver function of the patients, the MDT decided to schedule the patient for surgery.We therefore saw the patient in clinic and discussed the procedure.Informed consent was signed, and liver function was tested using ICG retention rate.We used 0.5 mg/Kg corresponding to 40 mg in this 80 kg patient.The DICOM data of the CT scan of the patient were then submitted to our radiologist who performed a 3D reconstruction of the patient’s anatomy and the relationship of the lesion with the major vessels.Furthermore, the exact dimensions of the portal territories for segment 8 were reconstructed and showed on the model.We normally aim at the narrowest but still oncologically safe resection possible.The surgery is then planned on the model, identifying the borders of the resection and the exact location of the Glissonian pedicle to tackle and the hepatic veins to skeletonize and cut.Once the preoperative surgical plan is discussed between the surgeons and the radiologists, the patient can be scheduled for surgery.This generally happens 2 weeks from the administration of ICG to achieve a complete washout of the dye by the normal parenchyma and a retention by the tumor that will then be showed intraoperatively using the narrow band camera.The patient is scheduled for a laparoscopic anatomical segment 8 resection.In our experience, we use the so called “French position” to operate laparoscopic cases, with the patient standing in between the legs of the patient and two assistants on each side.Two screens in the operating room are dedicated to the endoscopic vision, one screen is dedicated to the intraoperative ultrasound, while one dedicated screen allows to show the preoperative surgical planning and therefore guide the resection throughout the case.We use a five-trocar technique with 1 umbilical port and 4 ports on the subcostal line.One port is epigastric and is very important for the dissection of the hepatocaval confluence.An extra 5 mm access is used to perform an extracorporeal Pringle manuever.Open laparoscopy access is gained at the level of the umbilicus.After inserting all the trocars, the narrow band camera is used to identify the HCC on the hepatic dome on segment 8, which is shining green because of the ICG administered 2 weeks before.Intraoperative ultrasound and doppler are then performed to confirm the border of the resection.Pringle manuever is prepared.Dissection is started from the hepatocaval confluence to immediately identify the middle and right hepatic veins.For segment 8 resections, no extensive right lobe mobilization is necessary unless exposure is limited.We then start our parenchymal transection using a combination of energy-based device clamp-crushing technique, CUSA dissection and bipolar coagulation.We identify the middle hepatic vein at its origin, and we carry our parenchymal transection in a cranio-caudal fashion, sweeping the liver parenchyma from the vein.This avoids any tearing on small peripheral branches of the middle hepatic vein.Slowly progressing caudally, we encroach the Glissonian pedicle for segment 8, going to the lesion and vascularizing the tumor bearing area.We test the pedicle using a bulldog clamp and checking with the doppler the absence of flow in segment 8 and the presence of flow in the remnant liver.We then ask the anesthesiologist to inject 1 mL of ICG intravenously.We will then see all the liver shining green but not segment 8, which is our resection area.Guided by the ICG we will then carry out the anatomical resection.The Glissonian pedicle is stapled, and the resection is carried out dissecting the whole resection area from the middle and right hepatic veins.Once the resection is finished, the vascularization of the remnant liver is checked both with the ICG and the doppler.A drain is generally not placed unless there are specific issues during the procedure.The patient was placed on a fast-track protocol with early feeding and mobilization and was discharged home on postoperative day 4.Follow up is now more than 1 year and the patient is currently in good health status with no signs of recurrence.', 'A 29-year-old, non-lactating, and non-gravid woman presented with a complaint of a lump in her right breast.The patient also complained of low-grade fever and unilateral pain in breast tissue.The general physical examination showed a one-centimeter erythematous and tender mass in the right breast tissue.There was no nipple discharge, axillary lymphadenopathy, or external draining sinuses.The primary care physician evaluated the patient and called for a USG for the assessment of the affected breast, which demonstrated an ill-defined lesion with thin fluid streaks in the lower outer quadrant, suggesting an inflammatory lesion (Figure ).\\\\nAt the same time, cystic fluid from her breast was aspirated, and the bacterial culture test showed no growth of any microorganisms after 48 hours.The cytology revealed predominantly neutrophils and degenerating cells in a hemorrhagic background, which suggested an acute suppurative inflammatory process of the affected breast as shown in Figure .\\\\nBased on the clinical features, imaging findings, and cytology reports, a presumptive diagnosis of acute mastitis with underlying bacterial abscess was established.Subsequently, she was being prescribed a course of antibiotics and antipyretics for one week.However, instead of improving, her condition worsened over time.Therefore, the physician decided to repeat the ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration and cytology (FNAC).The sonomammogram of the right breast revealed an ill-demarcated hypoechoic irregular lesion involving the parenchyma of the right breast in the outer lower and adjoining upper quadrants.The lesion measured 34.4 millimeters on a long axis with no fluid components as shown in Figure .\\\\nThe repeated cytological examination also showed cellular clusters comprising histiocytes and epithelioid-like cells.Hence, based on these findings, the treating physician concluded that the ongoing clinical picture was more suggestive of tuberculosis of the breast.Therefore, after discussing with the patient, a therapeutic trial of an anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) was prescribed for four weeks.However, instead of any clinical improvement, her condition worsened over time and she had to visit her physician again just after three weeks.Her re-assessment by sonomammography was performed, which indicated an ill-demarcated hypoechoic irregular lesion, measuring 44.7×35.4 millimeters in the outer lower and adjoining upper quadrants of the right breast with thin fluid streaks as shown in Figure .\\\\nThe sonologist concluded that these findings were consistent with an infectious or inflammatory lesion.Afterward, the primary care physician referred her to a teaching hospital for a surgical consult.So, re-evaluation of the patient was performed by a detailed history, thorough general physical examination, and routine laboratory investigations.It was then planned to perform incision and drainage of pus collection and excisional tissue biopsy after surgical resection of the mass.The excisional biopsy material was sent for histopathology and pussy discharge for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear.After surgery, she received broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and moxifloxacin) for two weeks.The subsequent histopathology showed areas of acute and chronic inflammation along with predominant lobulocentric granulomatous inflammation as shown in Figure .\\\\nThese findings were suggestive of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis as an etiology.Concurrently, the AFB smear also came out to be negative.Hence, a final diagnosis of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis was established.Afterward, corticosteroids (prednisolone) were also added to the drug dosage regimen of this patient.The patient was followed up after one month, and during this period her symptoms had started to resolve.The medical team agreed to advise her to follow up until the complete resolution of her disease, and she was followed up monthly for the next three months.During these follow-up visits, we evaluated the patient for improvement in the clinical symptoms.Finally, a USG scan was performed, which showed complete resolution of the lesion with no abnormal findings.Table describes the timeline of all these events.', 'An 18-year-old female was admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital in November 2016 with the chief complaints of abnormal limb movements and slurred speech for two years, which worsened 20 days ago.Initially, her movements were slower, her hands were clumsy, and she could not speak clearly.In the past 20 days, she gradually developed dysdipsia, unsteady gait, dyskinesia, significantly increased involuntary movements of limbs and fell > 4 times.Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal signals in bilateral basal ganglia and thalamus.', \"A 76-year-old woman presented to our clinic due to fluctuating diplopia, worse at the end of the day while watching television, which gradually developed for 8 months prior to presentation.She complained about binocular vision in primary gaze position, in vertical and right lateral gaze directions.Her medical history included breast cancer surgically resected without recurrence, smoldering multiple myeloma, bilateral cataract and osteoporosis.\\\\nBefore presenting to us, she was evaluated as an outpatient.\\\\nNeurological examination showed right lateral rectus palsy causing an esotropia with gaze paretic nystagmus, moderate not fatigable ptosis and slight adduction deficit in the left eye.Pupils were round, equal and reactive to light.Vision was preserved on gross examination (the patient did not complain any vision loss) and confrontation visual field test resulted normal.Ophthalmological examination showed bilateral visual acuity deficit due to cataracts (20/63 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye), normal ocular pressure and normal fundus examination.The orthoptic measurements revealed an abduction deficit in right eye, a slight adduction deficit in left eye and a bilateral elevation deficit, greater in the left eye.The patient presented a 35 prism diopter esotropia in primary gaze.The strength of facial muscles, including orbicular oculi, was normal and Cogan's lid twitch sign was negative.The rest of physical examination was unremarkable.\\\\nLab test included a complete cell blood count, liver, renal and thyroid function test, and returned normal.\\\\nDue to the clinical history of fluctuating symptoms, a screening for myasthenia gravis was undertaken: serum assays for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies and muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies tested negative, electromyography (EMG) of the facial nerves with repetitive supramaximal stimulation and single-fiber EMG gave normal results.\\\\nWhen she presented to our medical attention she was admitted in our department and a brain MRI was undertaken.\", 'After a multidisciplinary evaluation, at the end of November 2019, a 13-year-old girl attended the Pain Therapy Clinic of the Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù in Rome, where acupuncture is also practiced as an analgesic technique.She reported pain in the left wrist and hand, with intensity 10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS), pulsating, and always present, thus preventing any movement.Marked hypersensitivity and allodynia were present at the level of the left fingers, wrist and hand.Pain was present in both flexion and extension of the wrist and caused a marked reduction in strength in the left wrist and hand, making a handshake impossible for the girl.There was no redness but swelling and sweating at the level of the fingers of the left hand.The pain was so intense that it interfered with her regular attendance at school, generating social withdrawal phenomena, which are unfortunately very frequent in patients with chronic pain.\\\\nPain began three months before the consultation, after an accidental fall with trauma to the left wrist.It gradually increased and did not respond to either NSAIDs or limb immobilization.The diagnostic tests performed at the time (X-ray, Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging) were negative, as were the blood chemistry tests ( and ).\\\\nFrom the age of 8, the girl was followed by a pediatrician in our hospital for a history of cramps and pain in the lower limbs, especially in the ankle and left knee, both in the absence of trauma or caused by frequent falls.In the following years, clinicians found bilateral flatfoot (with subsequent surgery), mild ligamentous hyperlaxity and vitamin D deficiency.In addition, borderline cognitive level with motor coordination disorder and executive function deficit, as well as stuttering, were then diagnosed.Elements of anxiety emerged from the administration of Self Administered Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents (SAFA-A, D and S) questionnaires, as highlighted in particular by the subscales “Separation anxiety” and “Generalized anxiety” [,].Concern for one’s own health was observed, with experiences of herself as being ill; the scores indicate a propensity to somatize.There was a tone of mood oriented in a deflected sense, and insecurity.The results of the Lie scale were: 8; T: 65 [,].In addition to pulsating headache with phono and photophobia, frontal epilepsy was also diagnosed, which could explain the frequent falls, and moreover had excluded hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a feasible regimen in this case (due to a cost/benefit evaluation, and increased exposure to oxygen toxicity during the treatment itself).Episodes of dizziness with difficulty in maintaining an upright position lasting a few hours were also observed, and on two occasions she also had an episode of unconsciousness lasting about 2 min.\\\\nDuring the first visit, as a consequence of the mother’s need to have time to convince the recalcitrant daughter, in the meantime it was recommended to administer oral tramadol (100 mg/mL), 5 gtt in the morning and 5 gtt in order to reduce musculoskeletal pain.The reason for choosing a drug such as tramadol rather than any other pharmacological option lies in the fact that the pain was so intense that it affected the patient’s relationships [].We therefore opted for a drug that would have an immediate effect, so as to be able to undertake the acupuncture course.Subsequently, in the first two sessions, after careful disinfection of the skin with 2% chlorhexidine, and using the appropriate needles for length and diameter based on the type of acupuncture and the selected points, we used the following acupoints: TE 4 (Yang Pool), TE 5 (Waiguan), LI 5 (Yang Xi) and SI 4 (Wan Gu), all on the left side.These points were chosen on the basis of a pathology which, according to traditional Chinese medicine, was caused by cold wind.These points produced heat and dissipated the wind [].The needles were kept for 30′, with stimulation every 10′.In the third session, the girl reported a slight improvement in the painful symptoms but at the same time unbearable pain in the affected limb during the previous sessions due to the insertion and maintenance of the needles in the affected area.We decided to change strategy and to use abdominal acupuncture and stimulation of the points CV 4 (Guan Yuan), CV 12 (Zhong Wan), CV 16 (Zhong Ting), CV 17 (Shan Zong), ST 24 bilateral (Huaroumen) and KI 17 bilateral (Shang Qu), with appropriate needles and maintaining the same interspeed and time of stimulation.The needles were inserted to a depth of 0.2 cun.These new points (CV 4, CV 12, CV 16, CV 17 and KI 17), in addition to heating and dissipating the wind, re-established the correct circulation of qi [].In fact, used in combination, their purpose was to move the qi from the kidney to the extremity of the upper limb passing through the shoulder [,].ST 24 was used to calm the patient and increase her compliance with acupuncture [].\\\\nAuriculotherapy was also associated with Vaccaria seeds on the Wrist, Hand and Shenmen points, with the recommendation to stimulate them at home for 10 min, 4 times a day until the next session.Vaccaria seeds are used to stimulate certain points in auriculotherapy due to their almost spherical shape, and the absence of pharmacological properties [].The Shenmen point was chosen for its anxiolytic effect, given the patient’s psychological difficulties [].\\\\nAfter eight sessions (two months) of abdominal acupuncture the pain completely disappeared (Numeric Pain Rating Scale value 0) and the girl regained full functional capacity of the arm and a normal life.Follow-up at three months, six months and one year demonstrated complete remission of symptoms, with constant values of NRS equal to 0.The reduction in pain, and subsequently its total disappearance, allowed the patient to resume normal school attendance, and therefore to resume a life of normal, balanced relationships.', 'A 64-year-old woman was brought to the emergency unit with chief complaints of headache and fever for one week in September 2017.She felt pain over her whole calvarium without a specific trigger point.Her body temperature was 38.7 degrees Celsius.There was no nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, or nuchal stiffness.Cranial and peripheral neurologic function did not have any impairment.Superficial lymphadenopathy, breast nodules, and abdominal tumor mass were not detected on palpation.A Babinski sign was absent.She denied drug or alcohol abuse.\\\\nLaboratory examination disclosed a normocytic anemia with hemoglobin level of 7 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume of 89.3 fl, platelet count of 325000/μl, and white blood cell count of 12000/μl comprising neutrophils 61.7%, lymphocytes 26.7%, and monocytes 10.8%.A leucoerythroblastic picture was not present.Blood chemistry tests revealed abnormally elevated serum alkaline phosphatase of 158 iu/l (normal 32~91) and lactate dehydrogenase of 292 iu/l (normal 98~192).There was neither microhematuria nor stool occult blood.Both activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time were normal in value but the D-dimer was extremely high: 6570 ng/ml (normal 0~500).\\\\nThe chest X-ray routine film showed no active lung lesions.A computerized tomography (CT) scan of head was ordered to rule out intracranial abscess or other central nervous system problems.The brain turned out to be intact but, unexpectedly, multiple osteolytic lesions were detected in the skull, extraordinarily obvious upon comparison with previous films taken six years earlier for other reasons ().She was then admitted to the ward under a suspicious impression of multiple myeloma.\\\\nSubsequent immunofixation electrophoresis analysis of serum, however, did not show any evidence of monoclonal gammopathy, and the levels of serum immunoglobulin G, A, and M were all within normal ranges.In contrast, serum tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) were meaningfully increased in concentration: CEA 8.1 ng/ml (normal 0~5) and CA 15-3 163.2 iu/ml (normal 0~31.3), respectively.Levels of cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) were within normal limits.Afterwards, a CT scan of chest and abdomen revealed osteosclerotic and osteolytic lesions similar to that of skull involving almost the whole skeleton () but not a single clear-cut primary tumor site could be located.\\\\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed on the right side posterior superior iliac crest.The aspiration smear demonstrated very scanty hematopoietic precursors scattered among crowded groups of oval neoplastic cells with large hyperchromatic nuclei, coarse chromatin, modest granular cytoplasm, and occasionally small nucleoli ().Frequent rosette-like openings were seen in the tumor groups.A metastatic adenocarcinoma was considered as the most likely diagnosis.\\\\nPathologic study of the biopsy specimen after decalcification displayed a picture of metastatic adenocarcinoma composed of round to oval tumor cells arranged in ovoid clusters, small rounded nests, cribriform nests, and focal microacinar pattern stuffed in bone marrow cavity ().The immunohistochemical stains gave positive results for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 8 (CK8), estrogen receptor (ER) (strong, 99%), progesterone receptor (PR) (strong, 99%) (), Smad4 (DPC4), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3), gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15), and mammaglobin ().While human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), paired box gene 8 (PAX8), and synaptophysin were negative.The positive rate of Ki-67 in tumor cells was 20%.Diffuse bone marrow metastasis from breast carcinoma (invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified) thus should be considered firstly as the diagnosis based on aforementioned pathological findings and differential diagnosis markers recommended in the literature [, ].\\\\nMammogram brought to light a suspect primary site in the right breast as compared with films taken five years earlier for cancer screening ().The lesion was also detectable in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ().', 'The patient is a 43-year-old man, Latin-American, with degree-level education.He attended the medical consultation after his wife noted a two-year history of progressive forgetfulness, mental confusion, disorientation, difficulty finding the right words, changes in mood (basically from being shy to outgoing).He also lost his job for poor performance and was rejected by his friends as a consequence of his new outgoing personality.Concomitantly, he started experiencing sleep changes and apathy, together with anxiety symptoms.Initially he was treated as suffering from major depression, and later as type II bipolar disorder.The treatments failed to change his behavior.The physical examination was completely normal, including pulmonary and cardiac auscultation (normal echocardiogram), except for multiple skin blemishes, mainly on the trunk.Neither he nor his wife recognized his skin changes as abnormal.The blemishes were spread all around his trunk and belly, and changed rapidly under finger pressure ( - right side with blue arrows).The patient was submitted to neuropsychological tests and we provide here a brief overview of the results: he scored 23 points on the Mini-Mental Status Examination and only 15 points on the MOCA test.He scored 30 points on the HAM-D scale and 20 on the Hamilton anxiety scale.The patient was CDR 1 and FAST stage was 5 (moderate disease).In general, the patient performed poorly on all neuropsychological tests, with moderate-to-severe decline in cognitive functions, including declarative memory, attention, and poor language and executive function results.He also presented many emotional disturbances that were negatively affecting his life.No further neurological signs were found.Lastly, neither the patient nor his wife described any stroke-like episodes.He reported no family history of livedo reticularis, stroke, vasculitis, or SS.\\\\nLaboratory findings showed undetermined anticardiolipin antibodies, besides the weak presence of lupic anticoagulant.Laboratory studies for venereal disease, human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C tests, protein C and protein S, C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear factor and other rheumatic testing were completely normal.\\\\nThe brain MRI () - upper left showed multiple areas of signal changes on cortico-subcortical transition and in the deep periventricular white matter with gadolinium enhancement, consistent with brain ischemia.', 'A cardiologist calls as they are planning a coronary angiogram for a 68-year-old trans woman and are concerned because the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is unknown.They are uncertain how to risk stratify her for potential contrast-induced nephropathy.She has a history of longstanding hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, vaginoplasty, and has been on various formulations of estradiol therapy for over 20 years.On review of her investigations, her serum creatinine is 109 umol/L (1.23 mg/dL) but her eGFR has not been reported for the last 18 months.Laboratory providers cannot report eGFR if a male or female marker is not provided on the request form, as this is required along with age to estimate eGFR.Using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, if classified as female, the eGFR would be 45 mL/min/1.73m\\\\nclassed as Stage 3 chronic kidney disease and would meet the guidelines for intravenous hydration prior to procedure.However, if classified male, the patient would have an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73m\\\\nwhich would be classed as Stage 2 chronic kidney disease and would not require prehydration.Which is the most appropriate eGFR to use?\\\\nAccurately assessing renal function is essential for not only assessment of renal diseases, but also clinical situations that may potentially affect renal function (such as diabetes or radioiodine contrast administration) as well as considerations for medication dosing of renally cleared drugs.The most commonly used marker of renal function in clinical pathology laboratories is eGFR, which is calculated based upon an individual’s serum creatinine level, age, and sex ().Typically, people presumed male at birth have a higher eGFR than people presumed female at birth at the same level of serum creatinine because the formula assumes a higher muscle mass in men contributing to the serum creatinine independent of renal function.The difference between these groups (given the same age and weight) is more marked at higher levels (with a difference of approximately 30 when eGFR\\u2005>90 mL/min/1.73m2), becoming much more similar as eGFR declines (difference of approximately 4 when eGFR\\u2005<30 mL/min/1.73m2).In clinical situations where accurate assessment of renal function is necessary, such as in the transplant setting, it may be more appropriate to use 24-hour urine creatinine clearance, urinary inulin clearance (), or serum cystatin c levels, which are less affected by sex and not affected by muscle mass in contrast to serum creatinine ().Inulin clearance and cystatin c are more expensive and less readily available.Creatinine clearance can be calculated on paired 24-hour urine and serum creatinine concentration and is independent of muscle mass and sex steroids.This can provide a baseline estimation for renal function and cumulative serum creatinine results can then be used to monitor decline in renal function with aging.\\\\nFrom a practical perspective, laboratory reports will need to make an assessment on how to report the eGFR for trans individuals.For individuals receiving masculinizing or feminizing hormone therapy, changes in body composition appear to be maximal in the early period after commencement, evident within the first 3 months of treatment (, ).For those receiving masculinizing hormone therapy with testosterone, given higher muscle mass and lower fat mass compared to females, the male CKD-EPI formula would be more appropriate.Conversely if a person has been on feminizing hormone therapy, which typically induces gain in fat and decrease in muscle mass from 3 months of use, then the female equations should be used.It would be a challenging task to expect pathology laboratories to provide the “right” eGFR given limited access to clinical information.\\\\nWe recommend that the treating clinician specify the sex-specific reference interval desired for reporting on the laboratory request (ie, female for a trans person using feminizing hormone therapy).Using current laboratory information systems, the gender marker can be used as a field to specify the reference range desired for reporting.While the binary female or male gender may not necessarily reflect the individual’s gender, this will allow for the appropriate reference range to be reported and the trans patient informed so they can prepare to be misgendered.For laboratory providers, if the gender marker is unknown, then treating clinicians should be contacted to specify the sex-specific reference interval desired.\\\\nFor the trans woman described in Case 2 who was on longstanding feminizing hormone therapy with female body composition, the female reference range for renal function would be most appropriate triggering appropriate renoprotection prior to administration of radioiodine contrast for her angiogram.From a harm reduction approach, given the absence of data in the field, if either the male or female calculated eGFR suggests renoprotective strategies, then this can be implemented.A 24-hour urine creatinine clearance can also be performed to more accurately assess renal function.', 'A 66-year-old male with back pain and cough for two weeks was admitted to the First Hospital of Jiaxing on 8 August 2019.A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that the malignant tumor on the left upper lobe was complicated by distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of the left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and the multiple bone metastases on 25 August 2019 (Fig.A).Immunohistochemical (IHC) results of the posterior iliac bone marrow biopsy specimen showed the positive expression of CD3, CD20, CD34, CD235a, and NPO, and the negative CD61 expression.IHC results of an endoscopic biopsy specimen of the bronchial mucosa on the upper left lobe showed the positive expression of TTF1, CK7, NapsinA, Ki67, CK, and EMA, and the negative expression of CK5/6, P40, CgA, Syn, and CD45 on 6 September 2019.Histopathologic observations showed infiltration of atypia cells in mucosal and fibrous tissues.The detection tools of pathology and cytology included automatic IHC staining (BenchMark XT, Roche, The United States), digital slice scanner, image analysis software (Pannoramic 250, 3DHistech, Hungary), and microscope (Eclipse Ci-S, Nikon, Japan).Finally, the patient was diagnosed with stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma combing with bone metastases.\\\\nTo seek potential therapeutic opportunities, the FFPE tissue and control sample (white blood cell) of the patient were detected using a 733-gene NGS panel in a College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificated lab.Sequencing reads were mapped against the hg19/GRCh37 genome, and duplicate reads were removed, followed by variants calling in targeted regions using an in-house developed bioinformatics algorithm.The algorithm utilized a filtering model containing background error correction, strand bias, base quality, mapping quality, short tandem repeat regions, and low-quality mapping ratio 25 [].The NGS analysis results indicated that the patient had an EGFR exon 19 p.L747_S752del somatic mutation with an allelic fraction of 73.19% and TP53 p.H179L germline mutation.Besides, the whole chromosome 7 and 5q deletion were detected using NGS-based copy number variation (CNV) analyses (Fig.), which were classical abnormalities associated with MDS.According to the clinical inquiry, the patient was a farmer by occupation, which means that he has long been exposed to certain chemicals such as pesticides, fertilizers, and solvents containing benzene.In addition, he smoked for 40 years.Taking all these findings together, we suspected the patient with secondary MDS.The results of the physiological blood indexes and the bone marrow aspiration test showed a decrease of platelet counts and the elevation of myelocyte counts.The proportion of blast was 5%, and the morphology of the cells presented the characteristics of MDS, which further confirmed our speculation (Fig.and Additional file : Fig.S1).\\\\nIn terms of treatment, the EGFR-positive mutation patient was administered with gefitinib starting from 20 August 2019.Due to decreasing platelet counts, azacitidine was administrated for four courses of treatment.However, the thrombocytopenia had not been significantly improved, and the size of the maximal tumor in the lung lesion did not decrease after seven months’ treatment (Fig.B).On 10 April 2020, a pathological report showed the infiltration of poorly differentiated cancer cells into the fibrous tissue.IHC results suggested the neuroendocrine tumor, in which small cell carcinoma and atypical carcinoid tumor accounted for about 40% and 60%, respectively.On 7 April and 28 April 2020, considering positive PD-L1 expression and high tumor mutation burden (TMB) in the tissue sample, the patient was administrated with toripalimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) and bevacizumab.Platelet counts returned to near-normal levels gradually, and the tumor lesion shrank obviously (Fig.).It was concluded that the patient reached a partial response (PR) (Fig.C).The progression-free survival was four months.', 'A 45-year-old woman with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix refractory to standard of care chemotherapy was referred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for enrollment in a Phase I clinical trial (NCT02484404) of combination therapy with daily cediranib, a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and once every 2 weeks of durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor.Her first four treatment cycles were well tolerated.Treatment related side effects included hypertension, subclinical hypothyroidism, non-nephrotic range proteinuria and mild diarrhea.\\\\nDuring a routine study clinic visit the patient was found to be in sinus tachycardia.Upon further questioning, the patient noted progressive dyspnea on exertion and fatigue over the previous month and was therefore admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for further evaluation.Vital signs revealed a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, a manual blood pressure of 90/72 mmHg without orthostatic changes and oxygen saturation ranging from 93 to 97% on room air.Physical examination findings were notable for a normal jugular venous pressure, regular heart rate without a prominent P2, clear breath sounds, and warm extremities without edema.Intravenous fluid was administered for possible dehydration due to diarrhea, but symptoms did not improve.A portable chest x-ray revealed hazy bibasilar interstitial markings (Fig.).Laboratory studies revealed a hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL (normal range 11.2-15.7 g/dl), a platelet count of 159 k/μL (normal range 173-369 k/μL), normal coagulation indices (PT 13.8 s; aPTT 35.5 s; thrombin time 15.8 s), a D-dimer of 0.98 μg/mL (normal range 0.00–0.50 μg/mL), a fibrinogen of 517 mg/dL (normal range 177–466 mg/dL), a pro-brain natriuretic peptide of 4541 pg/mL (normal range 0–124 pg/mL) and a troponin-T of 0.022 ng/mL (normal range 0.000–0.009 ng/mL).Echocardiography demonstrated a dilated right ventricle with decreased function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) of 8 mm; normal ≥17 mm) and an elevated right ventricular systolic pressure of 67 mmHg, new findings compared to her baseline echocardiogram completed just 4 months earlier.Cardiac MRI, performed to evaluate for possible treatment related myocarditis, demonstrated severely reduced right ventricular function (ejection fraction of 27%; normal 61±10%) with volume and pressure overload consistent with pulmonary hypertension, but no evidence of myocarditis.', \"A previously healthy 16-year-old female visitor from Japan presented to an adult emergency room (ER) with altered mental status and emesis.She was found lying on a bathroom floor in her hotel.There was a history of polyuria and polydipsia for 2 weeks and 8 to 10 kg weight loss during the previous month.Her vital signs upon arrival to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) were temperature of 98.1° Fahrenheit, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 26/min, blood pressure 140/81 mm of Hg, and 100% oxygen saturations without supplemental oxygen.Her capillary refill time was 4-5 seconds.Her weight was 57 kg.Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 13 in the ER, which improved to 15 upon arrival to PICU.Skin rash with infected lesions was noted in her groin.The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.\\\\nWorkup in the ER showed hyperglycemia of 472 mg/dL, metabolic acidosis (pH 6.75, pCO2 18.4, pO2 149, HCO3 2.5, base deficit 32.6, anion gap 23.5), ketosis (beta-hydroxybutyrate 11.41), glucosuria, and ketonuria, which were consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis.Her white cell counts were 22.3 k/L, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, and hematocrit 47%.The rest of her workup was unremarkable.\\\\nThe patient received fluid resuscitation with 30 mL/kg of 0.9% normal saline (NS) and 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate in the ER.Continuous insulin infusion was started at 0.1 unit/kg/hr.After that she was started on intravenous fluids containing 0.45% saline and 75 mEq/L of sodium bicarbonate.This was administered at 150 mL/hr, which was 1.25 times the usual daily maintenance requirement for her weight.A consultation with our PICU was obtained at this stage.No further bicarbonate boluses were given.Her fluids were changed to isotonic fluid with potassium phosphate and potassium chloride and without any bicarbonate.It was administered at the rate of 1.5 times maintenance of daily requirement for weight.She was transferred to the PICU at this stage, where she continued to exhibit severe metabolic acidosis with pH 6.97, pCO2 26.7, HCO3 6.1, and base deficit of 24.5. The DKA management was continued with close monitoring and serial laboratory evaluations.\\\\nAfter few hours of her arrival in the PICU, the patient became disoriented and confused.She was given one time 5 ml/kg of 3% hypertonic saline (HS) due to concern for cerebral edema and she responded well.Four hours later she developed lethargy followed by apnea.She was given additional doses of 3% HS bolus (5 mL/kg) and 0.8 g/kg of 20% mannitol.The hyperosmolar therapy was effective but only transiently; the patient eventually required intubation and mechanical ventilation for recurrent apnea.\\\\nCT head obtained at that time showed a thin, right parietal subdural hemorrhage without any evidence of edema or mass effect.Of note, CT scan was obtained after the initiation of hyperosmolar therapy.\\\\nHyperosmolar therapy was continued afterwards with 3% HS and 20% mannitol.It was guided with close monitoring of renal function including serum sodium and serum osmolarity.The doses and other parameters were maintained per standard of care [, ].\\\\nThe patient's serum sodium was 135 upon arrival in the ER and 143 at around 11 hrs before the initiation of hyperosmolar therapy and reached to 160 at 71 hrs when hyperosmolar therapy was discontinued.It was normalized to 143 at 131 hrs of admission.Her osmolarity was 298, 305, 335, and 299 at those timings (sodium in mmol/L and osmolarity in msom/kg).The rate of glucose reduction was < 50 mg/dl/hr.\\\\nMRI brain obtained at 60 hrs of admission showed mild edema of the cortex and sulci and diffuse edema of the pons and midbrain with restricted diffusion in the pons consistent with central pontine myelinolysis also known as osmotic demyelination syndrome.\", 'A 70-year-old trans woman who had been on feminizing hormone therapy for 6 months had a PSA performed as part of a routine health check.She was taking transdermal estradiol 100mcg/24hr patches twice weekly and cyproterone acetate 12.5mg daily.Her total testosterone was 1.5 nmol/L (43 ng/dl) and PSA was 2 ng/mL.She had mild lower urinary tract symptoms with reduced urinary flow over a number of years but had no family history of prostate cancer.How should she be managed?\\\\nThere are no studies examining the effect of feminizing hormone therapy on PSA.It is known that androgen deprivation as part of feminizing hormone therapy is associated with a substantially lower risk for prostate cancer than the general male population ().All published case reports of prostate cancer in trans people using feminizing hormone therapy have had histology showing high risk adenocarcinoma with PSA concentrations at diagnosis ranging from 5 to 1722 ng/mL (ng/mL equivalent to ug/L) (, ).Physiologically, in the setting of androgen deprivation in people with a prostate gland, it would be expected that PSA should be lower than the age-specific reference interval.There is insufficient data to recommend a specific cutoff for trans people using feminizing hormone therapy.Individualized decisions based upon clinical history and examination should inform need for serial monitoring for PSA velocity or imaging.\\\\nCase 3 had a digital rectal examination which showed a smooth but mildly enlarged prostate gland.She had an ultrasound of her prostate which showed a mildly enlarged prostate volume of 35 mL.Repeat PSA monitoring revealed progressive lowering of her PSA concentration with ongoing feminizing hormone therapy and an improvement in her urinary flow.', \"A 70-year-old African American male was seen in the emergency department for acute anxiety and paranoia.He reported that his son gave him melatonin to help him sleep, but he felt the medication was poisonous.He also reported that he was struggling with the death of his partner of 40 years and was feeling anxious.The patient was prescribed risperidone and lorazepam and was discharged shortly thereafter.Twenty-four hours later, he was seen again in the emergency department for worsening anxiety, psychosis, suicidal ideation, and command hallucinations.The patient's son reported that his father “had not slept in weeks.” The son reported progressive agitation, paranoia, and bizarre behavior.Due to the worsening psychosis, he was admitted to the medical floor for further work-up.He reported feeling as though people were watching him and that someone was going to harm him.When questioned about his reported suicidal ideation, he blamed that thought on his post-traumatic stress disorder; but would not elaborate on the event.The patient was given a one-to-one sitter due to his suicidal ideation.\\\\nThis patient lives with his family of seven children.He has a history of prolonged incarceration.His past medical history is significant for hypertension and negative for seizure disorders.The patient had never been hospitalized for psychiatric issues prior to this visit.He denied past suicidal behavior and any history of physically or sexually aggressive behavior.The patient reported a history of excessive alcohol abuse for more than a year following the death of his partner.He reported that he stopped drinking “cold turkey” five months prior to this visit.The patient's family history is significant for a son with an anxiety disorder.He denied a history of physical or sexual abuse in the past.\\\\nThe patient's mental status exam was significant for an anxious affect with referential and paranoid ideations.He denied any thought broadcasting, insertion, or withdrawal.He had some paranoid and persecutory delusions.Insight, judgment, and impulse control were poor.\\\\nThe patient's initial physical exam revealed an inability to ambulate and overall weakness.Further neurological examination revealed mental disorientation with bilateral muscle wasting, sensory deficit, and hyporeflexive ankles.Additionally, the patient exhibited stance and gait abnormalities.A later eye exam revealed bilateral light-near dissociation with accommodation but no reaction to light.Otherwise, all other neurological components were intact and within normal limits.\\\\nInitial routine testing was positive for the Treponema pallidum antibody, suggesting prior infection, but the distinction between treated and untreated syphilis cannot be made as the Treponemal-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) may remain elevated throughout life.An RPR was then ordered to help distinguish between acute or chronic infection and a Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test was ordered to distinguish between syphilis infection and a false positive screening test.The RPR returned nonreactive but the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination returned reactive, indicating a prior infection of Treponema pallidum.The initial differential diagnosis workup included testing to exclude thiamine, folate and B12 deficiency, insomnia, hypocalcemia, hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism, HIV encephalopathy, dementia, stroke, drug or alcohol intoxication, and normal pressure hydrocephalus.\\\\nFurther labs showed white blood cell count, sodium, potassium, calcium, anion gap, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, glucose, mean corpuscular volume, and thyroid stimulating hormone within normal limits.Urinalysis, toxicology screening, alcohol levels, and HIV antibody were also negative.Imaging included a head computed tomography (CT), which showed no abnormalities, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that showed cortical atrophy, and an electroencephalogram within normal limits.\", 'A 58-year-old man, with no relevant medical history, presented with a history of an enlarging painless mass at his right groin region for the past three months (Figure ).The patient did not have any other complaints or symptoms.Physical examination revealed a firm, skin-colored and mobile tumor with well-defined margins (5 cm largest diameter).There were no palpable adenomegalies.\\\\nThe patient was referred to the General Surgery department by a urologist, with suspicion of a soft-tissue tumor.An MRI described a “focal subcutaneous lesion with nodular morphology of 4.7 cm and no malignancy features”.', 'A 62-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension is admitted to the emergency room due to altered mental status noticed on awakening.She was somnolent, bradycardic and hypertensive, with a heart rate of 50 beats/min and blood pressure of 165/82 mmHg. On the neurological exam, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12 points (ocular: three points, verbal: four points, motor: five points), the patient was apathetic with non-fluent speech and normal nomination; no other abnormalities were found.The laboratory workup at admission was normal.An emergency brain computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral thalamic hypodensities.A 12-lead electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, transthoracic echocardiogram, carotid and vertebral Doppler ultrasound were performed, all of them reported normal.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed bilateral thalamic hyperintensities in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences (Figure ).\\\\nThe etiology of the stroke remained cryptogenic after the approach.', 'A 28-year-old Thai male with past medical history of E-beta-thalassemia and splenectomy presented to emergency department with a 3-month progressive tightness in bilateral flank region, weakness, and difficulty walking requiring crutches.Review of system was also significant for unintentional 10-pound weight loss due to poor appetite.Further review of history revealed that he was diagnosed with E-beta-thalassemia at the age of 13 months old.The condition was managed with intermittent transfusion, deferoxamine for iron overload, and hydroxyurea until he turned 21 years old when he stopped following up with his hematologist.He reported that, since then, his baseline hemoglobin was 6 g/dL.Vital signs at admission were within normal limits.Physical exam was significant for frontal bossing with depression of nasal bridge, bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness, slow broad-based gait with ambulation, decreased light touch sensation of the thorax at the level T7-T10, at left medial thigh, and in bilateral lower extremities below the knees.Further neurological exam revealed knee and Achilles hyperreflexia in addition to positive bilateral Babinski, clonus, and Romberg.\\\\nLaboratory studies were significant for leukocytosis of 72.5 × 109/L, hemoglobin 6.8 g/dL, platelet 732 × 109/L, and reticulocyte count 44.59%.Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed fetal hemoglobin of 49% and hemoglobin E of 59%.Total bilirubin was elevated at 5.3 mg/dL; the rest of the comprehensive metabolic panel was otherwise unremarkable.Further investigations showed that zinc, copper, folate, and vitamin B12 levels were within normal limits.Two-view chest, kidney/ureter/bladder, thoracic, lumbar, and pelvic spine X-rays showed prominence of ribs anteriorly, hepatomegaly, right paraspinal soft tissue prominence surrounding mid-thoracic spines, degenerative joint disease with osteopenia.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with/without contrast did not show any acute findings but did demonstrate diffuse enhancement involving the clivus and medial occipital bone with mass extension into the bilateral maxillary/sphenoid sinuses, posterior aspect of ethmoid cells, bilateral maxillary bones, inferolateral orbits, and parietal calvarium.', 'The patient was a 31-year-old male, a right-hand-dominant construction worker who was referred to our plastic surgery unit from a local minor injuries unit.He complained of pain in his left ring finger, following an inadvertent injury with a spray gun containing Newton 103-S (a type of liquid cement).The patient had been wearing protective gloves at the time of injury.He had no past medical history, took no regular medications, and had no allergies.\\\\nThe patient had been given tetanus immunisation by the referring hospital.He had a plastic surgery review approximately three hours post-injury.On examination, his left ring finger was swollen, erythematous with necrotic skin on the volar aspect of the finger (Figure ).There was no evidence of distal vascular compromise and the dorsal skin was well-perfused.He had a complete loss of sensation in the distribution of the ulnar digital nerve; however, the radial digital nerve was clinically intact.There was decreased range of movement at both the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) and distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ).The palmar skin was not involved.\\\\nBlood results and observations were within normal ranges.No X-rays were taken at the time of presentation.Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics were commenced, and the patient was taken to theatre for urgent debridement and washout under general anaesthetic.\\\\nThe initial surgical approach consisted of Bruner incisions.Significantly hardened concrete was identified in the subcutaneous tissues (Figure ).It was evident that skin and subcutaneous tissues were non-viable and were debrided, improving access.The pH of the wound was 8.5, in keeping with the alkaline substance injected; irrigation continued until pH returned to 7.The ulnar digital artery was thrombosed, but the radial digital artery was patent.The concrete had penetrated the flexor sheath, surrounding both flexor tendons.Subsequent flexor sheath washout from A1 to A5 confirmed that both tendons were in continuity but had undergone surface changes secondary to contact with the concrete.\\\\nA second look was performed at 48 hours; the distal digit remained viable with the flexor tendons appearing healthy.Tendon glide was impeded by friction within the flexor sheath.Access incision was made into the palm, which revealed further cement material.The passive range of movement was reassessed, which confirmed PIPJ and DIPJ to be in good condition.Further debridement of devitalised soft tissue resulted in a large defect of almost the full length of the volar aspect of the ring finger exposing the intact flexor apparatus pulleys and tendons (Figure ).\\\\nThe patient was counselled extensively regarding ongoing management, which principally consisted of either reconstruction of the volar soft tissue defect or potential amputation through the middle phalanx.He was counselled that the reconstructive option would result in a stiff and potentially insensate finger but could preserve length, while amputation might provide a faster recovery and better overall functional outcome.The patient opted for reconstruction and preservation of as much length of the digit as possible.\\\\nAt one week from the initial injury, a cross-finger flap from the ipsilateral middle finger was performed, reconstructing the volar soft tissue defect (Figure ).The patient was discharged with oral antibiotics.\\\\nAfter three weeks, the flap was divided and inset.However, the patient developed a wound infection five weeks after reconstruction, necessitating further washout and IV antibiotics.\\\\nAt four months post-injury, the digit had an active range of movement of 20-84 degrees at the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ); both PIPJ and DIPJ were in fixed 30 degrees of flexion.The protective sensation was maintained in the radial aspect of the digit, and the patient did not develop issues with pain subsequently.He was followed up via telephone consultation at 18 months postoperatively, and he reported that he had no functional limitations on daily activities, and was back to work.The skin overlying the volar defect of the ring finger and grafted area on the dorsum of the middle finger has healed well (Figures , ).', 'A 61-year-old man acutely developed diplopia and balance disorders.24 h after onset, he was admitted in the hospital due to ascending paresthesias and an emerging tetraparesis.On day 4 after onset, examination showed a drowsy patient with ophthalmoparesis, areflexia and severe tetraparesis.Plantar responses were flexor.The cerebrospinal fluid study was normal.IgM to Mycoplasma Pneumoniae and IgG anti-GQ1b (1:2560) were detected.IgG and IgM anti- GM1, −GD1a, −GD1b and -GM2 were absent.Two MRIs of the brain, one with gadolinium, were normal.', 'A 65-year-old right-handed Caucasian male presented with recurrent episodes of diplopia.Prior two episodes were brief and self-resolving; however, the current episode started two months ago and progressively worsened.He started perceiving objects brighter in the right eye.He also reported malaise, shoulder pain bilaterally, and approximately 15 lbs weight loss in the last few months.Exam showed bilateral CN VI palsy (right more than left) without any other focal neurological finding.Myasthenia gravis was earlier suspected and was ruled out clinically by negative blood tests and electromyography.Endocrine workup including thyroid panel was unremarkable.Computerized tomography (CT) angiogram of the head and neck did not show any flow limiting vessel stenosis.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain did not show any diffusion restriction.', 'Our patient was a 12-year-old Bahraini male who was seen initially in the A&E with a history of a fall from a height of around 2 meters on an outstretched hand.He had an obvious deformity of his elbow joint with an intact soft tissue envelope and no distal neurovascular deficits.Plain radiographs revealed a closed fracture-dislocation involving the olecranon process, a Salter-Harris type I fracture of the radial neck, and posterior dislocation of the elbow joint (Figure ).\\\\nOpen reduction and internal fixation of the fracture were undertaken the following day, under general anesthesia and in the lateral position; the elbow was approached posteriorly.The radial head was indirectly reduced and held using a 1.6-mm K-wire; the olecranon was reduced under direct vision and held with a tension band using two 1.6-mm K-wires (Figure ).\\\\nPostoperatively, the elbow was protected using an above-elbow slab for three weeks, after which both active and passive elbow range of motion (ROM) was initiated.The fracture healed uneventfully, and the patient had a complete ROM of 30-130 degrees at the elbow joint within six weeks of fixation.The implant was removed after six months.The patient was completely asymptomatic with a full range of flexion, extension, supination, and pronation along with the evidence of bony union (Figure ).', 'Herein, we describe the case of a 73 year-old man in good health, who developed widely disseminated sebaceous carcinoma including metastases to brain, visceral organs, lymph nodes, and bone.\\\\nHe initially presented in late October 2016 for removal of a rapidly growing nodule in the anterior abdominal wall.Two days later he developed confusion, urinary incontinence and progressive aphasia.Emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed 4 enhancing gray-white matter junctional lesions, the two largest measured 3.8 × 3.3 cm in the right frontal lobe and 2.3 × 2.5 cm in the left frontal lobe.', 'The patient is a six-year-old Caucasian boy, the younger in a family of two children (his sister was born with sensorineural hearing loss due to a common mutation of GJB2:35delG and received cochlear implants; her speech and development were normal after long-lasting successful rehabilitation).The patient was born after a normal, full-term pregnancy, delivered via normal, vaginal delivery at 40 weeks, with APGAR scores of 10/10.Early development was affected by recurrent upper respiratory tract infections frequently treated with antibiotics.At the age of 2, he was developmentally on target in motor and cognitive skills, used language for communication, and displayed normal interests, social activities, and behaviours that were appropriate for his age.At the age of 3, his parents noticed speech regression and behavioural deteriorations with unexplained irritability, tantrums, aggression, impaired reciprocal social interactions with limited and stereotyped interests and activities, and unusual responses to visual and auditory stimuli (i.e., moderate impairment to sort out multiple objects in visual scene, an inability to discern the orientation between objects in space resulting in fine motor dysfunction, and anxious reactions to normal hearing stimuli).Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with early childhood autism, mental retardation, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after psychological and psychiatric evaluations, using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria (American Psychiatric Association ).The diagnoses allowed him to access a specialized programme for children with autism in a government-funded early intervention programme.He has since participated in behavioural treatments organized in a kindergarten for autistic children.At the age of 4, the patient underwent a detailed paediatric and neurologic evaluation which did not reveal any clinically meaningful abnormalities.The 1,5 T MRI brain scans were normal.', 'We present the case of 33-year-old woman with genetically confirmed osteogenesis imperfecta type I.During childhood, she presented with the pathognomonic features of osteoporosis with multiple fractures and blue sclerae.At the time of consultation in our institution, she had complaints of progressive hearing loss and persist vertigo.\\\\nA spiral CT-scan with one millimetre thick sections of the temporal bone was performed.Symmetrical extensive lucencies in the pericochlear bony otic capsules, including the promontories, were demonstrated (Figure ).An additional 3T MRI was performed and included axial FLAIR imaging, axial diffusion-weighted imaging and gadolinium-enhanced 3D fast field echo imaging (3D FFE) through the entire brain.', 'The patient is a 91-year-old Caucasian man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, interstitial lung disease, and obstructive sleep apnea presented with a 2-week history of productive cough, fever, shortness of breath and generalized malaise.On presentation, vitals showed blood pressure of 77/35 mmHg, heart rate of 122 bpm, respiratory rate of 38 bpm, a temperature of 102 F, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 15 L of oxygen.The patient was diaphoretic, with decreased breath sounds in the right lung field, and on palpation of the abdomen, there was right upper quadrant fullness.\\\\nInitial laboratory studies showed elevated white blood cells (WBC) 22.6 × 109/L with neutrophilia, bicarbonate 21 mmol/L, lactic acid 6.5 mmol/L, anion gap 17, ALT 71 IU/L, AST 69 IU/L, and ALP 450 IU/L.ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.CXR showed acute right pleural effusion ().The patient was intubated for respiratory failure.He was also started on antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam and azithromycin) and intravenous normal saline with no improvement in blood pressure.The patient was then started on intravenous vasopressor support with norepinephrine and vasopressin and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).\\\\nDue to the right upper quadrant fullness, elevated liver enzymes and fever, an abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed an acute complex heterogeneous hypoechoic 8 × 7 × 6 cm mass-like lesion in the right hepatic lobe ().\\\\nTo better characterize the lesion, a CT abdomen was done.The CT showed a complex low-density right hepatic lobe subcapsular lesion measuring 13 × 8 × 7 cm, directly abutting the right anterior diaphragm, along with diffuse gross gallbladder wall thickening with cholelithiasis and a moderate right pleural effusion ().\\\\nThe patient underwent chest tube placement with the removal of 1600 cc of cloudy light-brown-colored fluid.Pleural fluid analysis was consistent with empyema, with WBC of 70,800 cells/mcL (61% neutrophils), glucose less than 10 mg/dL, LDH of 4821 IU/L, pH of 7.0, protein of 3.6 gm/dL, and Gram stain showing Gram-positive cocci in chains.Cytology was negative for malignant cells but showed severe acute inflammation and rare mesothelial cells.The blood culture on admission grew beta-hemolytic streptococci.The pleural fluid culture grew Streptococcus anginosus.On day two of hospitalization, the patient was scheduled for CT percutaneous drainage of liver abscess.However, the CT revealed a significant decrease in the size of the right subdiaphragmatic perihepatic collection to 1.5 cm in greatest thickness ().\\\\nDue to the improvement of the hepatic collection, the CT-guided drainage of the collection was not performed.Following the persistence of pleural effusion and decreased effluent from the chest tube, an intrapleural thrombolytic was instilled via chest tube with the removal of 1.5 L exudative fluid.Repeat CXR showed improvement in the right pleural effusion (), and the patient was successfully extubated on day three of hospitalization.\\\\nHis hospital course was subsequently complicated by new onset and worsening respiratory distress on day eight of hospitalization requiring re-intubation.Repeat CT chest showed diffuse narrowing of the left mainstem bronchus, occlusion of right posterior segmental bronchi with atelectasis, complete collapse of the left lower lobe due to occlusion of left lower lobe central bronchi with trace right pleural effusion ().\\\\nEmergent flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy was done and showed copious thick mucopurulent secretions that were suctioned to clear.The bronchoalveolar lavage grew Candida albicans, which was not thought to be a pathogen.After two weeks of hospitalization and the inability to wean the patient from the ventilator, the patient was terminally extubated, and care was focused on comfort.', 'In December 2015 a previously healthy 61-year-old woman started complaining of slowly progressing unsteadiness of gait due to left limb coordination impairment.In January 2016 she was referred to our Emergency Department for the subacute onset of unintentional sharp movements of left limbs, initially causing repeated falls and, later on, impossibility to reach and maintain the standing position.Neurological examination showed left limb proximal hyperkinetic-hemiballic movements with mild distal dystonic posture, mild asymmetric left-sided plastic rigidity and ipsilateral pyramidal signs.Cognitive function was normal (Mini-Mental Status Examination, MMSE 30/30), without behavioral, language, or psychiatric abnormalities.\\\\nLaboratory tests were in range except for severe hypercalcemia (15.1 mg/dl) related to primary hyperparathyroidism (PTH 422 pg/ml), which was gradually corrected with oral administration of cinacalcet, intravenous hydration, and zoledronic acid, without any improvement of signs and symptoms.\\\\nBrain computed tomography (CT) scan was normal, while brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed faint hyperintensity on Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images and positive diffusion-weighted (DWI) signal in the right lenticular and caudate nuclei, posterior insular and fronto-parietal cortex, without cortical atrophy or gadolinum enhancement (Figure ).', \"A 51-year-old woman was found comatose and hypotonic in her home.The patient was resuscitated and intubated on site and admitted to an external hospital.An opiate antagonization, because of suspected opiate intoxication (she was on a treatment of for chronic pain syndrome with fentanyl patches), did not show any effect on the patient's consciousness.She had a past medical history of arterial hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, and depression.\\\\nA blood sample-laboratory analysis revealed rhabdomyolysis.Subsequently, the patient developed acute kidney- and liver failure, which led to immediate transfer to the intensive care unit of our hospital.\\\\nOn neurological examination, the patient presented with coma, but did not show any focal neurologic impairment.An unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the head showed almost symmetrical bilateral hypointensities of the globus pallidus (Figure ).These changes were interpreted as of primarily hypoxic origin, possibly caused by carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, although there were no anamnestic indications supporting this assumption.A spinal tap showed no pathological findings of the cerebrospinal fluid (CFS).Four days after the initial event, the patient clinically improved and was cleared for extubation.The neurological examination thereafter was discreet with no focal neurological deficits and her mental status returned to normal.\\\\nMRI of the brain 3 weeks after hospitalization confirmed the bilateral lesions of the globus pallidus seen on CT, characterized by restricted diffusion and FLAIR-hyperintense signal changes (Figure ).\", 'A 48-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our emergency ward.His medical history included an episode of depression and some disabilities in reading and writing.From the age of 1 to 8 years, he had recurrent episodes of seizures associated with vomiting and loss of unconsciousness, which had been interpreted as febrile seizures.Ten years earlier he was diagnosed as having a peptic ulcer of the stomach after episodes of modest gastrointestinal bleeding.He had independently excluded protein from his diet during several periods of his life.\\\\nHe presented at the emergency room (ER) at 8 a.m. with complaints of headache, backache, and a sensation of pressure in his ears since the previous evening.He had felt nauseous and vomited several times during the night.Late in the night he developed altered sensorium and his wife brought him to the hospital.In the ER, he initially answered monosyllabically to questions (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 11) but within 15 minutes he lost consciousness (GSC 8).He was afebrile and his circulatory/respiratory systems were stable.On neurological examination he was motorically agitated, moved all extremities, and presented slight miosis and saccadic eye movements.The Babinski sign was positive bilaterally.Routine hematological and biochemical blood tests, including blood cell counts, electrolytes, liver parameters, intoxication screening, glucose, and C-reactive protein (CRP), turned out normal.Arterial blood gases showed a lactate concentration of 2.1 mmol/L and a pH of 7.5. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his brain was normal.\\\\nDuring the 12 hours after admission, he was still unconscious but could breathe autonomously and was circulatory stable.A lumbar puncture revealed a slight rise in lactate (3.7 mmol/L), but no signs of infection or inflammation.An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed suspected encephalopathy with pronounced pathological activity but no focality, asymmetry, or epileptic activity.Broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral treatment was given despite no obvious signs of central nervous system (CNS) infection.Twelve hours after admission, he had hematemesis and due to respiratory instability he was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU), anesthetized, and intubated.Concerns regarding a possible inflammatory lesion in his CNS led to administration of betamethasone.Acute magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including in-flow angiography, phase-contrast angiography, and diffusion series, was normal.\\\\nThe following morning, 24 hours after admission, the cause of unconsciousness was still unclear.', 'Our patient is a 23-year-old Chinese woman with UCD who presented with seizures 2 years after the latest episode of metabolic decompensation.She was the second child of a non-consanguineous union.Her elder sister and parents were well and there was no history of early deaths in the family, especially male family members.She was delivered at full term via an emergency caesarean section for failure to progress and breech position.Her Apgar was 7 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes, probably due to prolonged maternal anesthesia.\\\\nShe presented at 14 months of age with gross motor delay and intermittent vomiting after meals.She was alert and interactive.However, she was ataxic and her lower limbs were hypotonic with decreased power and brisk reflexes.The tone, power, and reflexes were normal in her upper limbs.She had intention tremors of the upper limbs.Computed tomography (CT) of her brain did not show any intracranial abnormalities.Her plasma ammonia level was markedly elevated at 327 umol/L (normal range 16 to 53 umol/L).She was treated with intravenously administered sodium benzoate with improvement in the hyperammonemia.She was diagnosed as having OTC deficiency in view of hyperammonemia, elevated glutamine at 1237 umol/L (normal range 400 to 700 umol/L), and elevated urinary orotic acid at 110 mmol/mol creatinine (normal range 0.5 to 3.3 mmol/mol creatinine).Her citrulline level was normal at 17 umol/L (normal range 5 to 60 umol/L).Sequencing of the OTC gene did not detect any pathological variant.The inability to identify a pathological variant by sequencing is not unusual.Pathological point mutation variants are found in approximately 80% of patients with enzymatically confirmed OTC deficiency.The remaining patients either have variants in the regulatory regions, variants within the introns, or have large deletions, all of which would not be detected by the sequencing that was done in this patient.\\\\nOur patient had multiple hospital admissions from diagnosis to 19 years of age, due to episodes of metabolic decompensation with plasma ammonia levels ranging between 157 and 278 umol/L (Fig.).These episodes occasionally occurred due to suboptimal compliance to protein-restricted diet, but most of the episodes occurred without any obvious trigger.She responded each time to intravenously administered sodium benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate, L-arginine and 10% dextrose infusion with normalization of the ammonia levels.She would then resume her protein-restricted diet, with orally administered sodium benzoate and citrulline.Functionally, she was independent in the activities of daily living.However, she was intellectually impaired with an IQ score of 40 and received special education.\\\\nShe presented with the first episode of seizure at 21 years of age.She did not have previous febrile seizures in childhood.There was no family history of epilepsy.She had altered mental state and incoherent speech on presentation.The plasma ammonia levels remained normal, ranging from 16 to 45 umol/L.\\\\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded non-convulsive seizures with the onset of rhythmic fast activity (Fig.), occasionally starting at the left frontotemporal region before becoming generalized (Fig.).These were associated with clinical manifestations of oral automatisms, impaired consciousness, and right-sided head turn.\\\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which was performed 2 days after the first seizure presentation, showed T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal hyperintensity in bilateral parahippocampal gyri with loss of gray-white matter differentiation and dilatation of bilateral temporal horns suggestive of hippocampal atrophy, due to mesial temporal sclerosis (Fig.', 'A 15-year and 11-month-old male patient was referred to our genetics unit at the age of 15 years.He was born at term to a third-degree consanguineous healthy parents with a healthy birth weight (3250 g), height (53 cm), and occipitofrontal circumference (34 cm).There was a prolonged labour, and the APGAR score was 7-8.His motor milestones were delayed, and he never walked alone.In addition, he had a social smile and could talk approximately 10 simple words.His seizures, although mostly absent, started at the age of 18 months and were well-controlled by valproic acid.Meanwhile, he also experienced clonic and generalized tonic–clonic (GTCS) and atonic seizures and had spasticity predominant in the lower extremities with no pathological reflexes.While electroencephalography revealed generalized spike-wave activities, electromyography and metabolic tests were normal.Furthermore, the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at the age of 3 years revealed moderate atrophy with prominent folia in the upper parts of the supratentorial cerebellar vermian region.', 'A 64-year-old Caucasian male smoker with a horseshoe kidney with a history of open pyelolithotomy 18 years ago, presented to King Abdulaziz Medical City in mid-2020 with a report from another hospital stating that he developed gross hematuria six months prior, which was treated as a urinary tract infection.A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed in that hospital, showing a horseshoe kidney with severe left hydronephrosis and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with the largest one located in the posterior part of the left renal artery measuring 4.7 × 3.5 × 2.6 cm.Additionally, there were multiple stones (Figures , , ).Urine culture was performed and revealed that various organisms were isolated (10-100,000 CFU/ml).Urinalysis showed a small amount of blood with a moderate presence of leukocytes and a trace protein.\\\\nAt the end of 2020, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).', 'A 60-year-old female presented to our tertiary medical center for a second opinion regarding the incidental pathology finding of stage III nonmucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma after an emergent appendectomy for perforated appendicitis at an outside hospital four months prior.Her initial pathology revealed primary nonmucinous, moderately differentiated, stage III, pT4pN1aM0, appendiceal adenocarcinoma, involving 1 of 3 periappendiceal lymph nodes with extensive lymphovascular space invasion.Mismatch repair protein was intact.She completed staging computed tomography (CT) and colonoscopy.On imaging, there was no evidence of distant metastasis, but a small right ovarian cyst and calcification of the gallbladder wall were noted ().The ovarian cyst had been evaluated intraoperatively at the index operation by a gynecologist, and it was deemed that no intervention was needed at that time.Completion right hemicolectomy and possible right oophorectomy followed by adjuvant FOLFOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) were recommended.However, she opted to forgo any treatment at that time.The patient was asymptomatic in the interim.The patient represented to clinic with CT findings of growth in the right ovarian cyst, from 4 to 11 cm, with a new 6 cm complex cystic/solid mass along the left pelvic sidewall ().On presentation, she complained of lower abdominal fullness and cramping with intermittent bloating and early satiety.Her exam was mostly unremarkable except for the fullness in bilateral adnexa.\\\\nHer case was presented at the multidisciplinary tumor board.At that time, her pathology was also reviewed ().We recommended completion right hemicolectomy as well as resection of adnexal masses, which were concerning for malignancy.We also discussed the possibility of cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy if peritoneal metastasis was discovered on exploration.In addition, she was recommended to undergo cholecystectomy at the same time.\\\\nIntraoperatively, the patient was found to have diffuse carcinomatosis.Cytoreductive surgery included right hemicolectomy, cholecystectomy, and total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with en bloc resection of the adnexal masses.This was followed by HIPEC with mitomycin C.The peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) was 20, and the completeness of cytoreduction score (CC) was 1 due to subcentimeter implants on the small bowel serosa from the jejunum to the terminal ileum.The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 6.\\\\nSurprisingly, pathology revealed primary gallbladder adenocarcinoma, moderately to poorly differentiated, arising in a background of high grade biliary intraepithelial neoplasm and porcelain gallbladder.The carcinoma extended through the visceral peritoneum onto the serosal surface and into the pericystic soft tissue on the hepatic bed surface ().All tumor deposits collected from the operation were consistent with metastasis from the biliary origin.\\\\nWith this new finding, her case was rediscussed at tumor board.The original appendiceal specimen slides were reviewed and found to be similar histologically to the gallbladder adenocarcinoma ().The possibility of synchronous gallbladder and appendiceal primaries was discussed but given the morphological resemblance between the two and the pattern of spread, primary gallbladder adenocarcinoma with carcinomatosis was the most likely diagnosis.\\\\nThe patient completed four cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin before switching to FOLFOX after surveillance imaging demonstrated disease progression.Shortly after receiving the first cycle of FOLFOX, she presented with an acute abdomen secondary to perforated viscus and underwent emergent laparotomy.She was subsequently transitioned to hospice.', 'A 59-year-old female patient presented to a plastic surgery clinic with a lump on her right medial thigh.She noticed the lump eight months ago and it was gradually increasing in size.It was painless initially; however, the lump gradually became tender.The patient was otherwise fit and well with no co-existing morbidities.Closer examination of the right thigh revealed a high consistency mass, with reduced mobility.There was no right inguinal lymphadenopathy or lymph nodes enlargement.\\\\nLaboratory blood tests were unremarkable.An MRI scan was requested to further assess the mass, which was irregular but well-defined in the medial compartment of the thigh, measuring 8.2 x 6.6 x 4.3 cm in size.', 'This was a 49-year-old woman with vulvar sarcoma who was irradiated with proton beam radiotherapy.Unfortunately, a very painful ulcer formed within the irradiation field one month after completion of treatment.Sustained-release oxycodone administration was started at 40 mg/day.The oxycodone dose was increased according to pain intensity, reaching 160 mg/day (MED 240 mg/day).The ulcer was treated with skin grafting and relieved the pain.The oxycodone dose was decreased every two days ().Mild restlessness occurred at 20 mg/day (12.5% of the maximum dose).Since the symptom was mild, the same dose was administered continuously and the restlessness disappeared after a few days.However, oxycodone 20 mg/day was continued for another two months before being reduced to 10 mg/day for 14 days and then discontinued.Six hours after discontinuing oxycodone, she developed cold sweats, malaise, and leg pain.Sustained-release oxycodone (10 mg/day) was restarted, and symptoms were relieved.This lasted for about five months because she was afraid of developing withdrawal symptoms.Final oxycodone discontinuation was achieved 323 days after the first onset of withdrawal symptoms.', 'A 72-year-old man with a history of bullous pemphigoid treated with a monoclonal antibody was admitted to another hospital due to a balance disorder.A neurological examination identified a left hemiplegia with no sensory deficits.An immediate CT brain scan showed a ring-enhancing cortical-subcortical lesion on the right frontal-parietal hemisphere.In view of the CT scan findings, gadolinium MRI of the brain was performed.', ': A 65-year-old hyperopic female was referred to our clinic because she developed left eye pallor with consistent VF loss.Her BCVA was 1.0 with correction +4.5 DSph and 0.5+ with correction +4.5 DSph, right and left eye, respectively.The IOP was 15 and 16 mmHg, right and left eye, respectively.Her angle in gonioscopy was narrow (I/II deg.), but neither acute nor prodromal glaucoma were confirmed, which is why an MR was performed.It revealed a left optic nerve sheath meningioma measuring 11 × 12 × 7 mm involving optic nerve canal.The tumor was totally removed by left craniotomy and pathology confirmed a diagnosis of psammomatous meningioma.The patient is stable and continuously observed; the BCVA 2 years after surgery is the same, 1.0 and 0.4, right and left eye, respectively.\\\\nSummary: this straightforward case of unilateral pallor of the optic disc justifies outright MR but, nevertheless, an MR may be retarded by the belief that a unilateral NTG could exist even without excavation, or by the suspicion of acute angle closure in the past.After acute angle closure in the disc, more pallor than cupping may be observed.', 'A 53-year-old man presented with a pruritic rash on the trunk as well as on the upper and lower extremities.Examination was notable for lichenified papules throughout the trunk and extremities, most notably on the back.Biopsies of the rash showed mild spongiosis with an underlying superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate ().Due to failure of topical halobetasol, topical tacrolimus, oral antihistamines, prednisone, and mycophenolate mofetil, dupilumab was initiated at standard dosing.Within 3 months, the patient noticed a dramatic improvement of his rash and pruritus, complaining only of mild pruritus between injections and minimal residual post-inflammatory hyperpigmented macules.Dupilumab was stopped after 1 year due to insurance reasons, and the initial pruritic rash returned.After insurance reapproval, dupilumab was restarted with complete resolution of his rash and pruritus.', 'A 20-year-old Caucasian male (1.75 m tall and 76 kg (BMI 24.8)), was admitted to the medical department for persistent hyperpyrexia, severe sore throat, dyspnea, and impaired consciousness with stupor.Persistent symptoms started at home 4 days before and he assumed clarithromycin as empiric antibiotic therapy.The physical examination showed jaundice, dry mucous membranes, pharyngeal hyperemia in the tonsillar region and soft palate, and left laterocervical lymphadenopathy.He was tachypneic (respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute) and the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) in room air was 92%.The abdominal palpation revealed hepatosplenomegaly.The laboratory tests showed a white blood count (WBC) of 8000 cells/mcL with 74% neutrophils, thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 31,000/mcL), total bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg/L, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, AST 150 UI/L, ALT 79 UI/L.The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR).Blood cultures were carried out upon admission and a full-body computer tomography (CT) was performed on the second day of hospitalization.The CT showed ground glass bilateral pulmonary alterations, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly ().\\\\nThe neck CT scan with intravenous contrast evidenced a 5.4 cm retropharyngeal abscess with associated thrombosis of the left anterior jugular vein ().\\\\nOn the second day of hospitalization, the microbiology laboratory communicated the early identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum grown in blood cultures by MALDI-TOF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight) spectrometry -Vitek ®MS Blood cultures performed at admission and on the second day and collected in standard anaerobic blood culture bottles were positive ().\\\\nThe association of retropharyngeal abscess with thrombosis of the anterior jugular and involvement of other organs systemically and the microbiology led to the diagnosis of Lemierre’s syndrome.Despite empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (18 g/day, continuous infusion), there was a rapid worsening of the clinical conditions with further impairment of the respiratory failure and severe hemodynamic alterations (mean arterial pressure (MAP) constantly <65 mmHg).This picture suggested a progression towards a septic shock status.Consequently, the patient was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\\\\nA multimodal approach was the core of the ICU management of Lemierre’s septic syndrome.It included source control, antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy, hemodynamic support, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) ().\\\\nThe source control was planned in a sterile environment.Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection.Unfortunately, although the procedure revealed purulent material, surgeons were unable to collect suitable samples for microbiological testing.\\\\nAt ICU admission, the patient showed a clinical and radiological picture of acute lung injury and the need for deep sedation (propofol, remifentanil, and clonidine), and mechanical ventilation through protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg and driving pressure < 15 cmH2O) and high FiO2 (80%).The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 12, predicting a high mortality rate (50%) [].\\\\nAbout antibiotic therapy, metronidazole (500 mg q8hr, intravenously) was added to piperacillin/tazobactam (started empirically at hospital admission).This antibiotic therapy was based on anecdotal clinical evidence because, due to the lack of cards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobes in the laboratory, the antibiogram was not performed.\\\\nHemodynamic support was based on the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin (also known as arginine-vasopressin or anti-diuretic hormone) (EMPRESSIN® AOP Orphan Pharmaceutical Group) starting with norepinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg/min and argipressin at 0.03 IU/min to maintain a MAP > 65 mmHg and lactic acid < 2 mmol/L.On day 2, the drug synergism allowed the rapid reduction of the norepinephrine and argipressin dosages (0.1 mcg/kg/min and 0.025 IU/min, respectively) ().\\\\nOn the same day (day 2), there was an enhancement in the clinical conditions, and the biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure improved ().\\\\nDespite the adequate MAP (>65 mmHg), from the 3rd to the 6th day of ICU admission, there was a new worsening of the clinical status.It featured anemia (worse value 6.8 g/dL) without evidence of a hemorrhagic source.The hemodynamic monitoring (Edwards EV1000™ device) showed a hyperdynamic septic state (Cardiac Output 15 L/min, Systemic Vascular Resistance 300 dynes/seconds/cm).Due to the worsening of the sepsis-related organ damage, on the 8th day, hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) was added to argipressin and norepinephrine.This approach led to a paramount hemodynamic improvement.From the 8th day of hospitalization, there was a progressive reduction of the dose of both vasoconstrictors until the suspension of norepinephrine, on day 9, and argipressin, on day 12 of ICU stay.Moreover, there was an important decrease in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (from 12 on ICU admission to 7 on day 9).\\\\nThe worsening of the clinical status and the anemia were associated with bilirubin and cytokines rise.The inflammatory response was treated by 4 cycles of continuous hemofiltration (from 4th to 7th day).At the end of the procedure, there was an unexpected rise in D-dimers and in bilirubin values, up to 15.3 mg/dL (10th day), as well as hyperpyrexia.Nevertheless, these findings improved within 24 h.\\\\nHeparin therapy was administered throughout the entire stay according to thrombocytopenia (enoxaparin 6000 U/day at the beginning and 4000 U twice a day after normalization of the platelet count) monitoring D-dimer values and avoiding intravascular coagulopathy.\\\\nOn the 9th day, a chest tube was placed for the drainage of lung pleural effusion and a new CT was carried out.It showed a persistence of the known injuries of the lungs, liver, and spleen despite the paramount improvements of laboratory and clinical values, as well as the normalization of hemodynamic parameters at monitoring.The patient was discharged to the ward on the 17th day to continue the antibiotic therapy and the rehabilitation program.After the discharge to the rehabilitation care unit, the young man was in good health condition.At the first follow up, performed 15 days after ICU admission, the CT scan showed better lungs ventilation, absence of retropharyngeal abscess, laterocervical lymphadenopathy, and internal jugular thrombosis.Hepatosplenomegaly and some cavitary lungs lesions were found.Another thoracic CT scan was performed after 3 months.It demonstrated an improvement of both the lung lesions and hepatosplenomegaly.', 'A 68-year-old man presented with a 6-month history of a pruritic rash that began on his back and legs and spread to his knees, elbows, shoulders, and chest.Patch testing showed 1+ positivity for both sodium laurel sulfate and benzaprene #4, which were deemed not clinically relevant.On examination, he had scattered erythematous scaly patches on the upper chest, shoulders, and back with overlying excoriation.Biopsy of the right shoulder showed an unremarkable epidermis and a sparse perivascular and interstitial mixed infiltrate containing scattered interstitial eosinophils, consistent with a DHR ().Oral prednisone initially cleared the rash, but it recurred on discontinuation.The rash was also recalcitrant to trials of topical steroids, oral antihistamines, and topical tacrolimus; therefore, he was transitioned to dupilumab at standard dosing.After 3 months, the patient reported complete clearing of the rash and pruritus.He did note occasional eye dryness, which was well-managed with artificial tears.', 'A 1-day-old white female newborn was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of our hospital because of persistent severe obstructive respiration with cyanosis of unknown etiology.She had been born in a peripheral hospital with a gestational age (GA) of 39 weeks, 1 day, with a birthweight of 2790 g and Apgar scores of 5 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.Pregnancy was uneventful with normal routine prenatal ultrasounds.Directly after birth, the girl showed apneas with profound desaturations.Respiratory support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was started without improvement.Also, antibiotic treatment was started for a neonatal infection.On admission, her central temperature was 38.2 °C, her heart rate was 145 beats per minute, her blood pressure was 65/40 mmHg, her oxygen saturation level was > 99% on room air and nasal CPAP, and her positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 3 cmH2O.On physical examination, she had a few dysmorphic features: small fontanelle, downward slanting eyes, low-set left ear, retrognathia, and sandal gap of both feet.Her heart rate was regular with normal heart sounds.Her voice was hoarse, and with CPAP she did not have an inspiratory stridor and showed no signs of increased work of breathing, with normal air entry of both lungs without rhonchi or crackles.Her neurological evaluation revealed no abnormalities.We considered the following in the differential diagnosis: upper airway disorder, congenital heart disorder with spells, intoxication, infection, neurologic etiology, and central hypoventilation syndrome.\\\\nAdditional examinations were performed.Her blood test showed normocapnia with balanced electrolytes and no signs of infection.Her urine toxicology test did not show any intoxication with amphetamines, benzodiazepines, methadone, or opioids.Her cardiac ultrasound showed a structural normal heart with no signs of pulmonary hypertension, and an ultrasound of her brain did not reveal any abnormalities, and cerebral function monitoring showed no epileptic activity.Because of the dysmorphic features, genetic testing was performed, which showed a normal DNA profile with 46 chromosomes.\\\\nOn day 2, a flexible bronchoscopy was performed, which demonstrated large arytenoids with relatively short vocal cords with sufficient residual lumen of the trachea.Gastroesophageal reflux therapy was initiated with esomeprazole, with no effect.Weaning from CPAP failed because obstructive apneas with profound desaturations returned.Subsequently, a rigid bronchoscopy was performed and demonstrated ongoing obstruction of the laryngeal airway by enlarged arytenoids and still short vocal cords in combination with an anatomic small larynx but without subglottic, tracheal, or main bronchus abnormalities.These findings in combination with retrognathia explained the obstructive breathing.\\\\nIn the following period, weaning from CPAP failed, and respiratory support needed to be intensified to noninvasive ventilation (PEEP 5 cmH2O, pressure support 12 cmH2O, respiration rate [RR] 30 breaths per minute).A second flexible bronchoscopy (day 23) was performed to exclude an upper airway obstruction.It showed findings similar to those before.Whether this contributed to the obstructive apneas could not be excluded, because the patient was examined in upright position and not in supine position.No laryngeal and subglottic abnormalities were seen on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the mouth and mandible.\\\\nBesides the obstructive apneas, the patient also increasingly developed central apneas without any signs of an infection.', 'A 62-year-old man, affected dysphagia, was endoscopically diagnosed with lower esophageal cancer confirmed squamous cell carcinoma on biopsy, and was reffered to our hospital (Fig.).He had no medical history.His lifestyle has included 1500 ml beer consumption per day and 40 cigarettes per day for the past 40 years.Computed tomography (CT) showed thickening of the wall in the lower esophagus as the primary lesion was demonstrated and the tumor formed a mass with the solitary metastatic abdominal lymph node, and invaded pancreas body and gastric body (Fig.).No other distant metastasis was detected on CT.He was diagnosed with lower esophageal cancer cT4 N1 M0, with pancreatic invasion, cStage IIIC according to 7th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control system [].At first, we considered definitive chemoradiotherapy.However, radiation oncologists evaluated that the tumor was less candidate for chemoradiotherapy because of the risk of gastric mucosal damage.For the purpose of definitive therapy, radical esophagectomy with distal pancreatectomy was planned.As neoadjuvant chemotherapy, CF therapy (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil therapy; cisplatin was dripped 80 mg/m2 plus 5-fluorouracil was infused 800 mg/m2 on day 1 through 4 continuously) was started according to standard therapy of localized advanced esophageal cancer [].However, after once administration, he could not continue chemotherapy for the exacerbation of dysphagia, and underwent radical surgery.Preoperative evaluation of tumor was similar to initial findings on endoscopy and CT.\\\\nIn findings on laparotomy, abdominal lymph node was infiltrated directly to pancreas body.As the radical surgery, Ivor Lewis esophagectomy with distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, followed by reconstruction of gastric conduit.Two fields lymphadenectomy was performed according to the treatment strategy of the abdominal esophageal cancer.Reconstruction of gastric conduit was possible although the lymph node was adherent to lesser side of gastric body, which was resected when reconstruction of gastric conduit.In addition, partial resection of lung was performed simultaneously owing to involvement of bilateral pulmonary ligaments to the primary tumor (Fig.).The operative time was 528 min.The estimated blood loss was 2850 ml, and the patient was transfused 4 units of red blood cell concentrates.\\\\nThe patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was able to take orally.He was discharged 16 days after operation with tube-free.After discharge, he underwent two courses of CF therapy as adjuvant chemotherapy.At present, he is still alive and has no recurrence for 7 years after surgery.\\\\nIn the resected specimen, the primary lesion was observed from lower esophagus to esophagogastric junction, and metastatic lymph node was fixed to stomach and pancreas body (Fig.).Pathological examination revealed that primary lesion was not infiltrated to lung (Fig.a, b).Massive metastatic lymph node (over 5cm) was observed in the lesser curvature of stomach, and infiltrated to pancreas and gastric wall with extranodal extension (Fig.c, d).The tumor was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated type.The vascular and lymphatic invasion was confirmed.The surgical margin was negative.The pathological stage was ypT4 N1 (1/61) M0 (metastatic lymph node invasion into pancreas), ypStage IIIC.The histopathological response of chemotherapy was grade 1a, which was equivalent that proliferable cells were 2/3 or more, in 7th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control system [].', ': A 60-year-old female was treated for NTG elsewhere but had been referred to our clinic with deterioration of the visual field.Her BCVA were 0.8 and 0.1, right and left, respectively, and she had normal intraocular pressure (IOP) (19 mmHg).Her parents were both treated for glaucoma, which could account for positive family history (treated with caution as we had not seen the parents).As both optic discs did not look glaucomatous, they looked a little pale but not excavated.The disc appearance did not match very advanced visual fields, so the patients’ drops were discontinued.The patient, seen 3 months later on follow-up visit, exhibited further deterioration of the visual fields with concomitant left vision loss.The BCVA had deteriorated to 0.2 and 0.02, right and left, respectively.An MR scan revealed olfactory groove meningioma that was successfully and subtotally removed by bilateral craniotomy.The BCVA improved to 0.9 and 0.9, right and left eye, respectively, and the VF improved significantly (RE completely, LE—significant loss remained).\\\\nSummary: this is a case of rapid bilateral vision loss with regard to the BCVA and VF (too rapid for glaucoma), in addition, VF did not match optic disc appearance.Positive or “pseudo-positive” family history may be misleading, causing protracted, unnecessary topical treatment, especially in case of putative NTG.', \"A 50-year-old Indian gentleman, a known case of diabetes and an active smoker, presented with a right eye painless inferior visual field defect upon waking up from sleep.At presentation, his right and left eyes' visual acuity (VA) were 6/24 and 6/9, respectively.Anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes.Fundoscopy revealed swollen right optic disc with peripapillary splinter hemorrhage (Figure ).Humphrey visual field (HVF) showed right inferior altitudinal scotoma.Computed tomography of the brain and orbit proceeded to rule out compressive lesions.Thus, a diagnosis of right eye NAION was made.Three months later, he complained of a worsening visual field of the right eye.VA remained static with the right eye (VA 6/24) and left eye (VA 6/9).Examination showed right eye relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) with impaired red saturation and light brightness.His right optic disc was pale; however, the left was hyperemic and swollen with peripapillary splinter hemorrhage (Figure ).HVF showed right eye tunnel vision while the left eye displayed inferior arcuate scotoma (Figure ).The patient was admitted for further investigations and was co-managed by the neuro-medical team.The visual evoked potential test was suggestive of right optic neuropathy.Serum glucose and serum hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were elevated, measuring 13.9 mmol/L and 9.1%, respectively.Serum total cholesterol (4.6 mmol/L) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (2.1 mmol/L) were normal, but triglyceride level was high (3.3 mmol/L).Full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (2 mm/hour), and C-reactive protein (0.7 mg/dL) were all within normal limits.Serum anti-aquaporin-4, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and infective screening tests were negative.However, magnetic resonance imaging revealed suspicious enhancement of both intra-orbital optic nerves suggestive of bilateral optic neuritis.Diagnosis of bilateral atypical optic neuritis was made.The patient was loaded with intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g/day for five days and subsequently oral steroid in tapering doses along with topical brimonidine tartrate 0.2%.At the end of one month, his VA remained static and fundoscopy showed left eye resolving optic disc swelling.Despite that, his left eye's visual field progressively deteriorated to inferior altitudinal scotoma (Figure ).Subsequently, we performed a lumbar puncture test, and the result was unremarkable.Repeated MRI of the spine and brain showed no focal enhancing lesion.\", 'A 46-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with intermittent back pain and chest tightness for 2 weeks.The patient works in ozone disinfection.Prior to symptom onset, he had a history of acute ozone inhalation.He recalled smelling something more pungent than usual for several days.Before coming to our hospital, he had not undergone any treatment.In addition, he denied any history of chest trauma.He had suffered from hypertension for over a decade and was treated with oral nifedipine and metoprolol.However, medication poorly controlled his blood pressure.The highest recorded systolic blood pressure with treatment was 180 mmHg. His blood pressure upon admission was 148/91 mmHg.\\\\nAn echocardiogram revealed a left SVA that ruptured into the left-ventricular myocardium, forming an echo-lucent cavity ().The left-ventricular wall had thickened resulting in uncoordinated motion and reduced systolic function.Moreover, moderate eccentric aortic regurgitation was also noted.Furthermore, CT angiograms better captured a large, left-ventricular, IPA arising from a small perforation in the left SVA ().The adjacent left ventricle and interventricular septum were compressed.With CMR examination, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) clearly demonstrated the left-ventricular IPA with distal thrombus and a linear enhancement of the IPA wall, compatible with myocardial fibrosis ().\\\\nSubsequently, the patient underwent surgery where the perforation was sutured and repaired, and the left aortic valve was lengthened with pericardial patches.Three weeks after surgery, a follow-up echocardiogram demonstrated the cessation of the abnormal blood flow in the left sinus of Valsalva ().', 'A 49-year-old female patient was admitted with complaints of fever, abdominal bloating, and losing weight for one year.She was diagnosed with cirrhosis and was treated at a local hospital.Three months ago, the patient deteriorated; thus, peripheral blood test, bone marrow (BM) aspiration, and bone marrow biopsy were performed.The results showed lymphocytosis in the marrow.Therefore, the patient was referred to our center.On physical examination, she had a fever (about 38°C), mild pallor, swollen legs, mild hepatomegaly, and huge splenomegaly.There was no purpura and no peripheral lymphadenopathy.There were no clinical infections and no joint damage.\\\\nComplete hemogram revealed hemoglobin of 117 g/L, platelet count of 82 G/L, total leukocyte count of 12.63 G/L with 65% lymphocytes, and 30% neutrophils.The peripheral blood smear showed lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia (Figure ).The lymphocytes were predominantly large lymphocytes, which were having abundant cytoplasm containing coarse azurophilic granules and clumped chromatin.Her biochemical examination was fairly normal.Serological examination revealed no evidence of HIV, HBV, HCV, EBV, CMV, or dengue infection.The results of cultures of fungi and bacteria in blood were negative.The ultrasound of the abdomen confirmed mild hepatomegaly and huge splenomegaly.\\\\nBone marrow imprint smears showed 33% lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) (Figure ).The lymphocytes displayed a medium to large size with a moderate amount of cytoplasm containing numerous azurophilic granules and a round nucleus with clumped chromatin.Bone marrow biopsy displayed an increasing level of cell density and lymphocytic infiltration in hematopoietic compartments with nonuniform size and similar morphology lymphocytes seen in peripheral smear (Figure ).The erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic series were suppressed.\\\\nCytogenetics revealed a normal karyotype.Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow showed that 49.5% of cells were of lymphoid origin.These lymphoid cells were positive for T-cell markers, including CD2, CD8, CyCD3, CD5, CD7, CD56, CD16, and TCR gamma delta.The cells expressed CD4-.These findings were suggestive of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia.\\\\nAfter being treated with methotrexate for one month, the clinical condition was ameliorated.The patient had no fever and splenomegaly regression, and the peripheral blood revealed an increasing proportion of neutrophils (65%).Therefore, the patient was given outpatient treatment and kept being examined monthly.', 'A 53-year-old male patient (hepatitis B carrier), who had been suffering for 3 months from HCC with multiple lung metastases, was admitted complaining of headache.A brain MRI scan that was performed to identify brain metastasis showed a solid mass occupying the left nasal cavity (3.7 × 1.8 × 2.8 cm).', 'A 39-year-old Japanese man presented with a 3-month history of numbness on the left side of his face.His symptoms had gradually progressed and had become painful in the month before the initial visit.He also complained that sometimes he could not chew on the left side.An examination revealed decreased sensation over the distribution of the left trigeminal nerve that did not respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or muscle relaxants and was only slightly responsive to carbamazepine.His symptoms were associated with dyskinesia of the left masticatory muscles but there was no clicking sound.His facial expression was symmetrical at rest.\\\\nHis past medical history was significant for acute gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and depression, for which brotizolam, flunitrazepam, and paroxetine had been prescribed, respectively.He was reticent and had difficulty communicating his feelings and wishes, which appeared to be related to his history of depression.Panoramic radiography revealed no specific findings relevant to his symptoms (Fig.) but did identify slight restriction of movement of the temporomandibular joint on the left (Fig.).MRI of the temporomandibular joint region was inconclusive for temporomandibular disorder and his symptoms were nonspecific for trigeminal neuralgia.', 'A 53- year old gentleman presented to the emergency eye service with a 1 week history of right visual disturbance with constant multi-coloured photopsia and reduced visual acuity.There was no significant past ocular or medical history.He was involved in a road traffic accident (RTA) 3 weeks earlier when his car was hit from the back but he sustained no injuries at that time.He was otherwise systemically well.\\\\nThe best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/12 in the right and 6/6 in the left eye.There were no anterior chamber or vitreous cells and no vitreous haze.In the right eye a large white deep retinal lesion, with an opaque appearance, was identified in the temporal retina, extending into the macular area and transecting the fovea (Fig.).The lesion had a unique shape and margins: the nasal aspects of the lesion had a geometric like shape, with defined linear straight and curved edges, and a pronounced bright white border; the remaining border was less defined and homogenous with the lesion.Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT, Topcon Medical Systems Inc., Newbury, UK) within the lesion showed hyper-reflective sub-retinal change (Fig.).Beyond the observed lesion edge, the ellipsoid zone (EZ) was disrupted in the nasal macular (Fig.) Small, well-defined creamy white sub-retinal lesions were also evident in the superior macular area of the right eye (Fig.).The left eye was unremarkable.(Fig.).\\\\nThe history of RTA led to consideration of commotio retinae, secondary to presumed whiplash injury from the car accident.Investigations for inflammatory and infective pathologies were negative including normal inflammatory markers, autoimmune screen, serum angiotensin enzyme, chest x-ray and syphilis testing.\\\\nSix weeks later, the patient reported full resolution of symptoms, including photopsia but the right BCVA remained the same.The area of retinal whitening and corresponding hyper-reflective sub-retinal OCT changes had resolved.Partial restoration of the EZ in the nasal macular was noted compared to earlier OCT.Multiple small macular sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) deposits had appeared, with corresponding hyper-autofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence (FAF).The left eye remained normal.\\\\nThe patient was lost to follow-up and re-presented 4 months later with recent onset blurred vision.The BCVA had deteriorated to 6/15 right and 6/19 left.There was no cellular activity in the vitreous but the posterior vitreous face appeared condensed and thickened.New retinal lesions were evident in the maculae of both eyes: in the right, a long, vertical lesion with ill-defined edges and different orientation, shape and margin appearance to the original lesion, was present; (Fig.) in the left, a similar, ill-defined white retinal lesion inferior to the fovea was noted (Figure ).OCT within these lesions demonstrated hyper-reflective sub-retinal change, similar to the original lesion (Fig.and ).More numerous bilateral sub-retinal and sub-RPE deposits were seen.(Fig.).\\\\nOne week later, significant evolution of the right lesion morphology was observed: the temporal margin appeared more defined with re-emergence of a bright linear edge; the lesion had increased in size; new sub-retinal deposits were identified (Fig.) and the lesion appeared to have migrated supero-nasally across the peri-papillary area, maintaining the outline shape temporally of the earlier lesion.Within the previously involved area, the sub-retinal lesion clinically appeared to have resolved and OCT demonstrated resolution of the hyper-reflective change with the RPE intact.(Fig., ) In the left, the lesion inferior to the fovea had evolved and was replaced by multiple small defined sub-retinal and sub-RPE deposits.(Figs., ) Fundus fluorescein angiogram (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICG) showed multiple hypofluorescent spots corresponding to the sub-retinal/ sub-RPE deposits.(Fig.) These lesions were more numerous than those clinically detectable.On FAF, there were hypo- and hyperautofluorescent spots corresponding to sub-retinal and sub-RPE deposits respectively.(Fig.) The patient was referred to the uveitis service for opinion.\\\\nPrior to review, the patient developed acute confusion and impaired neurological function.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, lumbar puncture and urgent brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of primary CNS diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\\\\nHe underwent MATRix (methotrexate, cytarabine, thiotepa, rituximab) chemotherapy and brain and orbital radiotherapy.', \"A 75-year-old Chinese male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and osteoarthritis arrived to our Emergency Department (ED) due to unstable gait.The patient stated that he was a resident of Yonkers, New York (NY).His only travel history involved a train ride to Flushing, NY, the day prior to presentation.The patient reported frequent walks in local parks around Yonkers, NY.At the time of initial examination, he denied headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, back or chest pain, rashes, focal weakness, or loss of sensation.He had not noticed any ticks or tick bites on his skin in the past year.On physical exam, he was noted to have normal extraocular muscle movements, neurologic exam without focal deficits, and musculoskeletal, cardiac, and respiratory exams without abnormalities.His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 beats per minute.His labs revealed slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and thrombocytopenia along with increased bilirubin levels.His chest X-ray (CXR), rapid influenza swabs, blood cultures for bacteria, and urine analysis were negative.He was treated in the ED until he was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic, after which he was then discharged.\\\\nHe returned 4 days later complaining of worsening fevers since discharge, with a maximum recorded temperature of 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.55°C), occasional rigors, chills, diaphoresis, diffuse myalgias, generalized weakness, malaise, confusion, and decreased appetite.The patient's gait was noted to be unstable with difficulty maintaining balance.On physical examination, the patient appeared lethargic.He was noted to be tachycardic at 98 beats per minute (bpm), to have a black discoloration of patient's tongue, and to have a recorded temperature of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit (39.33°C).His blood pressure, respiratory rate, and the remainder of his neurological exam was normal.His CXR was significant for fullness in the right mediastinum, cardiomegaly, and unfolded aorta.His hemoglobin, hematocrit, and comprehensive metabolic panel remained stable from previous admission.It was noted that the patient had decreased white blood cell (WBC) count and severe thrombocytopenia on readmission ().Initial serum ELISA for Lyme disease, used as a screening tool, was negative.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed no plaque deposition, demyelination, or other acute pathologic processes.\", 'A 29-year-old male was brought to the emergency department following a car accident.It was reported that the wheel of a 5-ton water tanker rolled over his lower body as he was stepping into a car.Workup revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15 with a pulse rate of 80 beats per minute and blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. There was profuse bleeding due to a perineum injury.No fractures of the skull, cervical spine, and pelvis were detected in the X-rays.Urinary catheterization was performed without difficulty and there was no hematuria.No internal bleeding was seen during the abdominal ultrasound.The patient was immediately taken to the operating theatre for injury assessment after the replacement of fluid and blood.\\\\nOperative Findings and Procedure\\\\nWhile the patient was placed in the lithotomy position, the anterior displacement of the anus could be seen with a circular skin defect surrounding the region.The anus looked normal.There was a remaining 1 cm of normal perianal skin with no actual skin loss.Digital and proctoscopy examination showed an intact anorectum and its surrounding sphincters.Whereas exploring the wound revealed complete disruption of the posterior pelvic floor with lateral extensions into both gluteal regions and the right thigh.In addition, a hand could be passed behind the rectum and into the sacral promontory.\\\\nThe case was associated with extensive venous bleeding with the absence of major arterial tears.It was managed by the insertion of multiple packs along with partial closure of the skin defect.A small incision was made to perform a defunctioning sigmoid colostomy.No intra-abdominal bleeding was reported.The packs were removed two days later without any bleeding complications.A total of 22 units of blood were required during the first 48 hours of admission.Figures , show the site of injury before and after treatment, respectively.\\\\nProgress\\\\nContinuous follow-up examinations were done during the following months of the accident.Seven examinations under anesthesia were performed.The skin was not closed completely at the site of the procedure.Consequently, it was decided not to reallocate the anorectum to a further posterior direction and the wound was left open.Initially, infection of deep injury recess was found and debridement and daily cleaning with betadine was performed.In later stages, as the wound became clean, saline dressings were substituted and the wound healed by granulation.\\\\nThe defect was reduced to an area of 4 x 2 cm after four months of the procedure and was contracted towards the coccyx.Anterior to this, the anus felt normal on digital examination with a good sphincter tone and squeeze.\\\\nPhysiological tests were done to test the sphincter function and sensation.Manometry showed the resting sphincter pressure of around 30 cmH2O.This increase in squeeze pressure was due to a combination of contraction of the puborectalis and gluteal muscles.The presence of rectal sensation was noted but not quantified.Defecography was assessed using a defecation proctogram.It revealed a normal anorectum that was displaced towards the pubic bone.Furthermore, although he was able to evacuate barium paste from the rectum, the anorectal angle did not widen during straining at the angle of 90°.Anyhow, there was no abnormal descent of the rectum on straining.\\\\nFive months after the surgical procedure, the perineal wound healed, and the colostomy was closed.The patient was able to pursue normal defecation without any episodes of major or minor incontinence.In the following follow-up visit, the patient expressed satisfactory defecation and micturition without incontinence.', 'A 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes was admitted to our hospital with a two-week history of abdominal pain, jaundice, nausea, anorexia, and episodes of loose stools.Physical examination revealed right-sided abdominal tenderness.Laboratory examination revealed slightly higher bilirubin levels (0.4 mg/dL), but serum amylase and lipase levels, and complete blood count were all within the normal range.Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated a large cystic mass in the head of the pancreas, which measured 8.1 × 7.5 × 7.4 cm, and dilatation of the common bile duct, measuring 22 mm in diameter.There was also dilatation of the pancreatic duct, measuring 5 mm in diameter.The remainder of the pancreas was grossly unremarkable.Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).The EUS FNA fluid test showed a CEA level > 900 ng/mL, and fluid cytology was negative for malignancy or high-grade dysplasia.Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed with biliary stent placement, which led to the resolution of his jaundice.An extended pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed.The operation was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 4 days after surgery.\\\\nGross examination: The pancreatic head was entirely replaced by a mass lesion measuring 8.2 × 7.9 × 7.2 cm and was a unilocular cystic lesion containing gray-green turbid fluid with granular material.The cyst structure appeared to communicate with both the main and side duct branches.The cyst lining was gray-green to yellow, trabecular, and glistening to granular with few fibrous strands that arborized through the cystic structure and anchored at opposing sides of the cyst.Using a standard pancreatic cancer sampling protocol, paraffin-embedded sections of formalin-fixed tissue were studied by routine histology at the Indiana University Pathology Laboratory.\\\\nMicroscopic examination: Histologically, the tumor showed two components composed of an epithelial component and a spindle cell component that were intimately intermingled together.The epithelial component had features ranging from well differentiated to moderately and poorly differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.The majority of the epithelial component was well differentiated with simple small to large ductal structures lined by a single layer of columnar to cuboidal cells, which had small and basally located nuclei with smooth and round nuclear contours and open chromatin.They had a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm without mucinous content ().The moderately differentiated component showed a more complex glandular structure with convoluted and interconnected ducts with a single layer of cells or a cribriform-type structure including multiple layers of cells with enlarged and irregular nuclei ().Some areas showed prototypical morphology of conventional pancreatic ductal carcinoma with small and angulated ducts infiltrating the desmoplastic stroma.The poorly differentiated epithelial component was small and focal.It showed vague and poorly formed ductal structures, or solid nests to small sheets of dispersed epithelioid cells with no ductal structures ().These cells had enlarged vesicular nuclei with irregular nuclear contours and conspicuous nucleoli.The spindle cell component was highly cellular with compact spindle cells, which showed hyperchromatic and elongated nuclei with scant cytoplasm.There was rare mitosis in the epithelial component, but the spindle cell component showed frequent mitosis with up to 12 mitoses per 10 high-power fields.Frequent apoptosis was also observed in spindle cell areas.Scattered necrotic areas were present in both components.There were no osteoclast-like giant cells or rhabdomyoblasts and no osteoid formation.There were foci of hemosiderin deposition, especially in the spindle cell areas surrounding the cystic lining.None of the ducts showed papillary or mucinous features.No areas subjacent to the epithelial component showed ovarian stroma-like features.All margins were negative for tumor.Twenty lymph nodes were present, all of which were negative for metastatic tumors.The pathologic staging was pT3pN0.\\\\nImmunohistochemistry: Extensive immunohistochemical studies were performed at the Indiana University Pathology Laboratory due to the mixed features of the lesion ().The epithelial component was positive for markers of pancytokeratin AE1/AE3, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CK7, and CK19, and negative for MUC2, MUC5, MUC6, synaptophysin, and chromogranin.Spindle cells were negative for these markers.The spindle cells were diffusely positive for vimentin and DOG1 with patchy positivity for S100.Both epithelial and spindle tumor cells were negative for the estrogen receptor, CD10, inhibin, TLE1, SOX10, Melan A, HMB45, actin, desmin, myogenin, MyoD1, STAT6, and CD117.No nuclear staining was observed for β-catenin.CD163 highlighted cells with hemosiderin deposition, consistent with histiocytes.The tumor cells were negative for CD21 and CD35 expression.P53 showed a wild type staining pattern with no complete loss or overexpression in tumor cells of both components.Cyclin D1 showed patchy nuclear staining in the epithelial component but was negative in the spindle cell component.P16 was positive in the spindle cell component but negative in the epithelial component.The spindle cells demonstrated approximately 20% positivity of Ki-67 nuclear staining, while it showed only scant (about 2%) nuclear staining in the epithelial component ().Additional immunohistochemical staining for PDL-1 (SP142), MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 was performed at the Caris Life Science Laboratory (Phoenix, Arizona) and showed negativity (0%) for PDL-1 expression and intact protein expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2.\\\\nMolecular study: Molecular analysis of the tumor tissue was first performed by Indiana University Molecular Pathology Laboratory and showed that the tumor was microsatellite stable with no mutation in BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS genes.Additionally, the tumor tissue was sent to the Caris Life Science Laboratory (Phoenix, AZ, USA) for next generation sequencing analysis of whole exome sequencing (WES).Direct sequence analysis was performed on genomic DNA using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencers.Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was low and genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was also low, with 10% of the tested genomic segments exhibiting LOH.The whole exome sequencing in our case showed no pathogenic alterations in the genes, such as BRAF, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, SMAD4, NRG1, and NTRK1/2/3.However, the results for AXL1, HDAC1, MED12, NOTCH1, PIK3CB, POLD2, PRKACA, PTPN11, TERT, and XRCC1 were indeterminate because of the low coverage of exons in these genes.\\\\nThe patient was followed up for three months after surgical resection.The last time he had an appointment for discussing the adjuvant chemotherapy.But he was then lost to follow up without receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.', 'A 61-year-old man had originally presented in 2012 with stage IVA oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).He was treated with surgery followed by chemoradiation.Eighteen months later, he presented with a pancreatic mass and multiple osteolytic lesions.These were proven by biopsy to be metastatic oropharyngeal SCC.He was treated with carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and cetuximab with resolution of the pancreatic mass.On follow-up CT post 6 months of maintenance cetuximab, he was noted to have an asymptomatic left occipital brain metastasis for which he underwent stereotactic radiation.Three months later, he underwent left occipital craniotomy for relapsed disease.Imaging revealed a new enlarged paratracheal lymphadenopathy, and he was started on nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg.After 3 months, he had a partial response.However, when he presented for day one of cycle 8, he complained of sudden onset fatigue.Brain MRI showed no new lesions.', 'A 72-year-old white male with end-stage liver disease due to cryptogenic cirrhosis underwent a deceased-donor orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in 2010.The post-transplant immunosuppression (IS) regimen included tacrolimus 5 mg twice daily, prednisone 20 mg daily, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1000 mg twice daily.\\\\nHe remained relatively well until seven years post-transplant when he presented with right foot pain and right lower extremity swelling for a duration of 4 weeks.Doppler ultrasound showed an acute right popliteal, tibial, and peroneal deep venous thrombosis for which he was prescribed apixaban.Two months after the initiation of anticoagulation therapy, he presented with a recurrence of right lower extremity swelling, increased pain and numbness, and a new weakening of the right foot.Further history revealed progressive fatigue, dyspnea, and a 30-pound weight loss over 3 months.\\\\nA computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed scattered lung nodules with multiple areas of bilateral thoracic lymphadenopathy.A positron emission tomography (PET-CT) revealed the abnormal FDG uptake of numerous, sub-centimeter bilateral pulmonary nodules (max SUV 8.4) with mediastinal (1.6 cm, max SUV 13.4), bilateral hilar, right femoral, inguinal adenopathy, and abnormal FDG uptake in a soft tissue mass adjacent to the proximal right femur (5.8 × 3.9 cm2, max SUV 11.9) ().\\\\nAn excisional biopsy of the soft tissue mass showed diffuse infiltration with atypical monomorphic lymphoid cells with large regions of necrosis ().By immunohistochemistry the tumor cells expressed CD3, CD4, CD30 (30%), and BCL-2, and were negative for CD5, CD8, CD10, CD20, CD21, TIA-1, perforin, T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma, and ALK-1.In situ hybridization for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA was negative and plasma EBV DNA was not detectable.The proliferation index estimated by Ki-67 staining was 70–80%.TCR gene rearrangement analysis showed a monoclonal band for both the TCR gamma and beta genes.A bone marrow biopsy showed normocellular bone marrow, with trilineage hematopoietic maturation, and no lymphoid aggregates or atypical lymphoid cells, but with a mononoclonal TCR rearrangement identical to that found in the soft tissue mass, consistent with a low-level involvement by T-cell lymphoma.He was diagnosed with stage IV CD30-positive T-cell PTLD, peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), which was not otherwise specified (NOS).\\\\nAt the time of the PTLD diagnosis, IS therapy consisted only of tacrolimus 1 mg twice daily.After discussion with the transplant team, the tacrolimus dose was decreased to 0.5 mg twice daily, and CHOP-21 chemotherapy was initiated.However, based on the emerging ECHELON-2 outcomes with the addition of brentuximab vedotin (BV) to an anthracycline-based chemotherapy backbone in CD30-positive PTCL, after two cycles of CHOP, the patient’s chemotherapy regimen was changed to BV-CHP [,,].BV was dosed at 1.8 mg/kg with CHP every 3 weeks with G-CSF support, according to the published ECHELON-2 regimen [,].Cycle 3 (BV-CHP #1) was complicated by neutropenic sepsis, and BV was reduced to 1.3 mg/kg for cycles 4–6.Cycle 4 (BV-CHP #2) was again complicated by neutropenic sepsis, and cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin dosing were reduced by 25% for the remaining cycles 5 and 6.Interim PET-CT after cycle 4 showed a complete resolution of previously seen pulmonary metastases, a decrease in the mediastinal (1.3 cm, max SUV 9.3; from pre-treatment 1.6 cm, max SUV 13.4) and hilar adenopathy, and a near complete resolution of the soft tissue mass in the right anterior thigh (2.4 × 2.3 cm2, max SUV 1.68, from pre-treatment 5.8 × 3.9 cm2, max SUV 11.9), overall consistent with a partial response (PR).End-of-treatment PET-CT after cycle 6 showed stable disease in the mediastinal (1.3 cm, max SUV 10.25) and hilar adenopathy, and no new or recurrent adenopathy, with complete resolution of the previously seen right lower extremity soft tissue mass, consistent with ongoing PR ().Maintenance therapy with single-agent BV was discussed and started, but after one BV maintenance dose he was again admitted with a neutropenic febrile episode and the patient requested to stop all therapy, as he was satisfied with the achieved response.\\\\nFollowing completion of front-line therapy, his course was complicated by elevations of alkaline phosphatase (peak 417 U/L 3 months post-treatment initiation, from pre-treatment 97 U/L) and AST (peak 75 U/L 11 months post-treatment initiation, from pre-treatment 33 U/L) levels.ALT remained within normal limits.A liver biopsy completed 8 months after treatment initiation showed minimal lobular inflammation, but no evidence of portal inflammation, bile duct injury, or endothelitis, as seen with acute cellular rejection, and no ductopenia, as seen with chronic rejection.\\\\nDue to chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and an episode of duodenal ulcer bleeding, his anticoagulation was briefly interrupted and then re-initiated after endoscopy clipping and the recovery of thrombocytopenia.His known DVTs were monitored with serial Doppler ultrasound, which demonstrated a chronically dilated, thrombosed right popliteal vein with post-thrombotic venous changes, representing chronic thrombosis despite being on anticoagulation.No additional complications were observed.Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia normalized 4 months after the last dose of BV, with mild persistent anemia (8–11 g/dL).He remains alive and well 25 months since his diagnosis without clinical or radiographic evidence of progression.', 'A 53-year-old man presented with a gradually increasing mass located in the soft tissue of the oral cavity.The lesion was biopsied, and the pathology report showed increased infiltration of the buccal mucosa with monoclonal plasma cells.Immunochemistry demonstrated positivity for CD138, CIgA, and negativity for CD56, Cyclin D1 and CD20.Therefore, the diagnosis of soft tissue plasmacytoma was confirmed, for which he received localized radiotherapy with a total dose of 40 Gy, due to the absence of systemic disease as the bone marrow biopsy revealed the absence of neoplastic infiltration and serum and urine immunofixation were all negative.\\\\nAfter five years, the patient noticed a painless swelling in his right testis.An ultrasound of the scrotum was performed that showed a hypoechoic mass in the right testicle with increased vascularization, and a normal-appearing left testis (Figure ).The patient subsequently underwent a right radical orchiectomy and the histopathology report showed testicular infiltration by a plasma cell neoplasm with identical immunophenotype (CD138+, CIgA+, CD56-, CD20-, Cyclin D1-) to the primary site in the oral cavity.Subsequently, the patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy that showed the absence of monoclonal plasma cell infiltration, and a PET/CT scan that was negative for reactive lesions suspicious of malignancy.In addition, serum and urine protein electrophoresis, as well as serum-free light chain assay were all within normal range, thus, excluding the presence of systemic disease, while complete blood count and full biochemical profile were normal.\\\\nHowever, after one year, the patient presented again with painless swelling of his left testis that was attributed to disease relapse based on the imaging findings (Figure ).He refused to undergo left orchiectomy, thus he proceeded with systemic treatment based on lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone.Following 4 cycles of treatment, the patient underwent high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation.The blood tests of the patient revealed an increase in serum creatinine (1.3 mg/dl with 1mg/dl baseline level), normal calcium levels and normal complete blood count.Complete response was achieved with negative PET/CT scan and negative marrow minimal residual disease assessment.The patient continued on lenalidomide maintenance; however, six months later he was diagnosed with disease relapse in his left testicle (Figure ).A PET/CT scan was then performed, and showed a reactive lesion with an increased SUV max of 7 in the left testis, with no other loci suspicious of disease relapse.The blood analysis of the patient revealed no abnormal values.Since the patient refused surgery, he was initiated with next-line therapy, with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, he responded partially and still remains in remission (Figure ), while serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation and serum-free light chain assay, all remain within normal levels.', 'A 47-year-old male with a past medical history notable for hypertension on metoprolol succinate, morbid obesity, and pre-diabetes presented to the emergency department (ED) with a chief complaint of generalized weakness.The patient tested positive for COVID-19 and exhibited mild unspecified respiratory symptoms.He was subsequently discharged home to recover in isolation per the CDCs COVID-19 response protocols.One week later, the patient returned to the ED for ongoing symptoms and was admitted requiring supplemental oxygen for hypoxia.Upon admission to the hospital, the patient was noted to have difficulty standing and ambulating.Two days into his inpatient stay, the patient developed urinary retention issues requiring intermittent catheterization.Three days later, he developed facial weakness and numbness.The clinical diagnosis of GBS was suspected and subsequent EDX studies reported AIDP.The patient was treated with a five-day course of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG).Three days after the completion of his IVIG treatment, the patient noted improvement with right upper extremity anti-gravity strength.\\\\nThe patient was transferred to inpatient rehabilitation with significant proximal lower extremity weakness.The bilateral upper extremities demonstrated slight weakness.The bilateral lower extremities demonstrated a significant loss of strength, 1/5 dorsiflexion, and 3/5 plantar flexion bilaterally.The patient also reported diminished sensation to light touch in bilateral upper extremities in all dermatomes.His blood pressure upon rehabilitation admission was 110/73 mmHg.\\\\nPrior to hospitalization, the patient was independent with mobility and all activities of daily living.Upon evaluation in the inpatient rehabilitation, the patient was at a significant functional decline from baseline, requiring dependent assistance with toileting hygiene, showering, upper body dressing, lower body dressing, footwear management, rolling left and right, and all transfers.The patient was unable to ambulate due to his level of impairment.In inpatient rehabilitation, the patient completed three hours total of physical, occupational, and speech therapy per day five days a week with exercises aimed to improve balance, mobility, activities of daily living, fine motor skills, cognition, and breath support.\\\\nAfter completing four weeks of inpatient therapy, the patient was independent with supine to sit, upper and lower body dressings, and rolling right and left in bed.He required minimal assistance to lift the left lower extremity into the bed and moderate assistance with wheelchair-to-bed transfers and bed mobility.He was able to stand with the assistance of his spouse and by using significant reliance on bilateral upper extremity support on a walker for stability and offloading lower extremities.He required a power wheelchair for mobility and was unable to transfer in and out of the car thereby requiring a wheelchair van for transportation.Final muscle strength grading was not documented.His blood pressure remained stable throughout his stay on metoprolol succinate and was 121/65 mmHg on discharge.', 'A 31-year-old African American female was found to have severe anemia on laboratory work performed by her gynecologist.The patient reported fatigue and dyspnea on exertion for about two months.She also had a two-week history of gum bleeding while brushing her teeth.She denied any other bleeding, weight loss, chills, or fevers.She had occasional blurry vision for about two weeks.Physical examination was unremarkable except for proptosis of the left eye.Visual fields and acuity were normal.A complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 18 × 109/L with 50% blasts, hemoglobin of 5.7 g/dl, and a platelet count of 18 × 109/L.Bone marrow aspirate showed myeloblasts (64.2%) by flow cytometry.The myeloblasts were positive for CD13, CD33, CD34, MPO, and HLA-DR and negative for CD20 and CD19 on immunophenotyping.Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed translocation t(8;21).Testing for FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3), CEBPA (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha) and NPM1 (nucleophosmin 1) was negative.Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was negative for involvement by leukemia.MRI of the brain demonstrated bilateral orbital masses measuring 2.6 cm on the right and 1.2 cm on the left ().', 'A 16-year-old boy presented to eye casualty having noticed a brief episode of flashing lights followed by acute inferior hemi-field visual loss in the left eye while walking to class.The visual loss persisted, and the event was completely painless.Past medical history consisted only of migraine which the patient was not experiencing at the time of visual field loss.He denied any history of smoking, illicit drug use, alcohol consumption or sexually transmitted infections.\\\\nExamination revealed a normal visual acuity of 6/6 in both eyes.A clear inferior altitudinal defect was evident when visual fields were tested to confrontation and a supra-temporal wedge of retinal pallor with associated arterial attenuation was visualized on slit lamp ophthalmoscopy.Colour retinal photography confirmed evidence of a superior branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) (ref.Fig.) and visual field testing confirmed an inferior altitudinal field defect in the left eye (ref.Fig.).Aspirin was commenced at this point and the patient was referred for urgent review with the local stroke team.Trans-thoracic echocardiography revealed a bicuspid aortic valve but reassuringly no vegetations that may have produced emboli.MRI and MR-angiogram of brain and neck were unremarkable.', \"As home care doctors and general practitioners, we encountered a 37-year-old woman with ASD who lived with her parents in Japan.Her mother had end-stage breast cancer.We visited her house regularly to care for her mother.The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired.There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\\\\nWhen we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD.However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members.According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care.They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition.She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not.She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them.Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder.We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer.The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\\\\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood.Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis.The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis.The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother.The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill.Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter.We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting.When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily.For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\\\\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother.Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day.We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles.We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\\\\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily.The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife.She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition.Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice.These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation.After this event, we explained why her father become silent while during the explanation of her mother's condition.We made a rule that we will tell her beforehand what we would say and how she should act when we share bad news.For example, we told her beforehand that we were going to tell her father about her mother's poor condition and prognosis and asked her to listen until we finished.We also told her how her father would react and our guess of the reasons for his reaction.Inappropriate behavior that is not suitable for the situation decreased afterward.She also felt relieved that she knew what she should do and could support her father as much as possible.\\\\nSeven months after the start of home-based care, the mother passed away at home as her mother and she herself hoped.When her mother needed to use oral opioids and subcutaneous injection of opioids, the woman with ASD was able to communicate with homecare staff and ask for help to offer better care for her mother.Her mother died peacefully without any severe pain or discomfort.The woman with ASD did not become confused and was able to accept her mother's death peacefully with her father.\", \"An 11-year-old boy was referred to the Dermatology outpatient clinic with a complaint of patchy hair loss on his scalp noticed by parents one month before.On examination, he had 3 x 2 cm patch of alopecia on the occiput, without scarring.A diagnosis of alopecia areata was considered and treated with topical steroids.Four months later, he presented with intermittent fever, cough and weight loss that started from the past 45 days.\\\\nOn examination, he was pale and cachexic with hepato-splenomegaly (16cm and 16.4cm, respectively).There was no cyanosis, clubbing, lymphadenopathy or pedal oedema.Alopecia over the scalp was regressing.Rest of the systemic examination was normal.Investigations showed anemia (Hb: 5.2 Gm%), elevated acute-phase reactants (ESR -99mm/hr, CRP-185mg/L) & Serum LDH levels (428IU/L) with hypo-albuminemia (3.14 Gm/dl).Mantoux test and serological tests for the diagnosis of HIV, HCV, HBsAg were negative.Sputum AFB and aerobic culture were also negative.USG abdomen and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) () identified enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen (extending from D11 to L4 vertebral level) and thorax (paratracheal), so a preliminary diagnosis of lymphoma was made.There was no evidence of consolidation or other abnormalities in CECT thorax.Bone marrow study showed no evidence of infiltration.A diagnostic laparoscopic biopsy was done, and histopathological () examination (Reed-Sternberg cells) and immunohistochemistry {positive CD15 & CD30 (membrane and Golgi zone), negative CD 20, CD 3, LCA, ALK 1} was consistent with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (Lymphocyte-rich).A diagnosis of stage III B classical Hodgkin's lymphoma was considered.\\\\nOn the sixth post laparoscopic day, two episodes of generalised tonic-clonic seizures followed by altered sensorium were observed.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain (, ) was suggestive of pontine demyelination.\", 'A 75-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of well-controlled hypertension and hypercholesterolemia presents to the ED with complaints of a new-onset headache.She describes her headache as constant and refractory to over-the-counter pain relievers.Her physical examination is unremarkable.She has no ocular complaints, and no eye examination is performed.A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain is performed and reported to be normal.She is discharged with a prescription for Vicodin.Two weeks later, she returns to the ED with a worsened headache and blurred vision.The ophthalmologist on call is consulted by telephone.Visual acuity is noted to be 20/25 in both eyes (OU), pupils are round reactive to light, and no afferent pupillary defect is present.The patient has small pupils that precluded an easy view to the back of the eye with a direct ophthalmoscope.Attempts to check intraocular pressure are unsuccessful as the tonometer would not calibrate.A slit lamp examination is not done as the machine is not working.A CT and computed tomography angiogram (CTA) are performed at the recommendation of the tele-neurology doctor on call, both of which are normal.No labs are ordered.The patient is instructed to see the ophthalmologist in the morning.When the patient wakes up the next morning, her vision is worse.On examination in the ophthalmologist’s office, her visual acuity has decreased to 20/400 right eye (OD) and 20/25 left eye (OS).\\\\nGiant cell arteritis (GCA) is a common disorder that presents to the ED and should be high on the differential for all elderly patients presenting with a headache, visual loss, or diplopia [,].presents the most common presenting symptoms.Asking the right questions is crucial in preventing permanent blindness.On further questioning, the patient denied jaw claudication and temporal tenderness but did complain of ear pain and eye ache.Other historical clues that can be helpful include polymyalgia rheumatica, weight loss, fatigue, and abdominal pain due to mesenteric ischemia [,].Laboratory evaluation should include the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and complete blood count including platelet count [,].A list of the most commonly abnormal lab values for the disease process are listed in .These laboratory tests are elevated at diagnosis in most patients and crucial to monitoring disease activity [,].However, 20% of patients have normal laboratory testing [].CRP is much more sensitive than ESR, but the combination of all three is the most helpful and also guides management [,,].Acute serum amyloid A (A-SAA) is less readily available but also highly sensitive [].Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without gadolinium of the orbits and temporal artery may be very helpful [,,,].']\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
